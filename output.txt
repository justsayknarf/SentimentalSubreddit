You wouldn't have known when Hosico wanted to sleep......\nits not my cat just stumbled upon the video on youtube and shared it here. so i cant tell :) posted the link to the cats channel in my other comment. \n\nEdit: link to the video. Doesnt have much views yet https://youtu.be/VHVC8wcR-fo\nCompliments for sharing other's original material the right way. \nThe right way would be to simply link directly to the video in the first place, not reproduce nearly the entire video in gif form. This is virtually the same exact thing as the whole Facebook \"freebooting\" debacle. Even if they give credit to the original content creator by linking to them, they've still taken the views from them. Not everyone reads the comments, and since the gif is essentially the entire video, there's little reason to watch the video after viewing the gif.\n\nEDIT: Here's a great video explaining the freebooting problem and the harm it does to content creators: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7tA3NNKF0Q\nI am 100% less likely to watch a clip if I have to leave Reddit to do so, so while technically you are correct, he did me and everyone else a favor by recreating the gif for us to just look at and upvote, and even sited the original video / author afterwards, instead of claiming it was his like most of Reddit tends to do.\nundefined\nNot clicking that, can someone make a gif?\nI wouldn't click the link if it was youtube, but I might I'd definitely click the gif and likely watch a linked video\nYeah I only browse reddit on mobile so if I don't need the sound I would much prefer watching a gif to a video\nundefined\nYou're the letter of the law relative that everyone hates talking politics with at Thanksgiving, right? You sound like the English university professor who takes points for a single comma out of place in a citation. The important thing here is OP, gave credit where credit is due, hence satisfying the spirit behind the citation system.\n&gt;takes points for a single comma out of place \n\n[The horror](https://media1.giphy.com/media/9SMXEQv1lcVva/200w.gif)\n\n\nNo, that is not the \"right\" way. What he did is perfectly fine. You need to go back to the internet police academy.\nundefined\nundefined\nThe reddit way... \nOk. No probs, thanks for replying. \u0001F60A \nPlace box, catch cat. Doesn't take long.\nI wish. My poor guy has some really bad PTSD about boxes. :(\nStory time?\nYes please\nundefined\nundefined\nI thought you meant your cat came across this video on its own for way too long...\nyay good OP! Who's a good OP?! You are!\n\nEdit: sorry if that sounded condescending haha\nThis was already posted before and got to front page like a week or two ago... But I ain't complaining, cuz this is so fckin CUTE!!!\nWow, that video really doesn't have many views. Only about 400 or so at this point, while this gif has over 4000 upvotes. Hope he gets more views.\nFat hamster kitty was on here the other day, good to know he's internet famous too\nThere's plenty of views on their instagram account\nManny *\nJust like a muffin! \nundefined\nHosico always wants to sleep.   And lasagna. \n\n\nAnd he hates Mondays. \ni think i know the perfect companion for Hosico!\nA [cute little teddy bear](http://i.imgur.com/QqzvNRT.jpg)?\nA house full of spiders? Seriously, that comic has a disturbing amount of spiders coming down from the ceiling.\nJon does lead a shitty life it's easy to assume he lives in a spider infested dump\nundefined\nundefined\nThe secret is, cats always want to sleep\nEven at 6 AM when they want to be fed?   Then again, they probably would prefer to eat while sleeping, but haven't yet found a way.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/MZVoj\n\n\nThere is a chosen one\nPut a box like item down and the cats will come\nMaybe that's his bed and when they take it out, he wants to sleep in it.\nCats seep for 12 to 16 hours a day, so the cat being sleepy is in your favor.\nKnowing my cats you basically just have to put a box on the floor. 5 minutes later you have a cat in it.\nwhiskey in food bowl?\nPut a box on the floor and eventually the cat will climb in it. Cats seem to love things that are not meant for them. Like cardboard boxes. You could buy the most expensive cat bed ever and they would rather sleep in the cardboard box it came in.\nundefined\nI felt like I could see all the way into its soul when it yawned.\nI love cats but this one looked like a demon when he yawned O.o  \nHad to watch the gif twice to make sure there weren't rows of teeth in his maw\n http://i.imgur.com/gpJ4DaK.jpg \naww look at those wittle fwont teeth\nundefined\nWhen my cat yawns, it's terrifying.

[ferocious](https://imgur.com/a/DZOSi) \nHaha, aw, he's like an angry little jaguar.\nYawns like Totoro!\nIt yawns like a [Cacodemon](https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/doom-cacodemons-screenshot_1920-0.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=all&amp;w=780) from the recent Doom.\nwhich one of the souls.

I don't know a lot about cat breeding. I was just repeating what it says on the cat's Instagram.\nThe Scottish fold is just a British Shorthair with a specific gene mutation that fucks with their cartilage and bones. \n\nThey're just a genetically deficient version of the British Shorthair. \n\nSo if it's got straight ears, it likely doesn't have the mutation which means it's just a British Shorthair. \n\nPeople should really stop buying Scottish Folds. The genetic mutation is generally horrible for their health.\n\nThe mutation should have died out with the original cat, but unfortunately people like the look of the folded ears so now we have cats out in the wild needlessly introducing health problems into the cat species. \nA Scottish fold can be either an American shorthair or a British shorthair. \n\nThe cats have no underlying health issues and life expectancy is =&gt;15 years. \n\nI don't know where you got your info but it's wrong lol.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Fold#Health\n:(\nundefined\n&gt; straight variety.\n\nNot that there's anything wrong with that.\nundefined\nGolden tipped British Shorthair\nClose but not quite.  That is a Tunesian Jigger cat.  It's a rarer breed, but getting more popular recently, and can range between $2500-$4000 a kitten.  They tend to dig worms out of gardens, and elsewhere.  They can be a nucance if you live somewhere with lots of moist soil.\nJigga please\nThese jiggas wont hold me back\nDid.. did you just make this up?\nundefined\nundefined\nA cute one :)\nundefined\nCats mind:  If it fits it sits.  err if it sorta fits it sits.  umm... aw hell I'm sitting, who cares if I fit.\n\"If I mostly fits, I sits.\"\nI think I fits, therefore I sit.\nIs there a subreddit of only cats getting into boxes? \nYouTube Maru\nThat's exactly what this made me think of! I love Maru!    \n\nOne of my favorites is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqY-t0la2q4). Hana just walks by as if she's saying \"Maru where are you?\"\n/r/thecattrapisworking\n/r/catsinboxes \n\nNot terribly active though. :c\nAlternatively; /r/ifitfits \nThat sub is even less active.\nAha, but what about r/IfIFitsISits.\nundefined\nI hate to blaspheme Maru, but I vote for this cat as his understudy. \n\nIt's the roundness. Also the sitting in tiny boxes. Let's see how Hosico does with a running start.\nGoodnight, chubbs.\nI fits?\n\n*fits*\n\nYeah, I fits.\n\n*sits*\n\"Fuck, the human is pointing his video thing at me again, I guess I've gotta do more adorable stuff. What a horrible life.\"\nHosico is an adorable round little bastard.\nThis cat looks like Garfield.\nMess with that cat... You make a dozen copies of that basket that are just a bit smaller than the last. Everyday you swap out the basket for the next smaller one until you reach the smallest and than reverse the process. \nThat's like when I try to fit into a dress that's two sizes smaller \"I WILL fit!\"  5 mins later..... \"Someone get me out of here\". \nIf it fits I sits!\nhttp://welovecatsandkittens.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cat-paws-in-tiny-box.jpg\nCat, I am. Fit, I will.\nCan anyone explain to me the reason for this common feline behaviour of sitting in small boxes?\nundefined\nMove over maru!\nCute, fat cat looks like a chipmunk.\nThe cat's name means snout.\nundefined\nWHO IS THIS HOSICO AND WHY DON'T I HAVE ONE?!!?1?\nFat cat in a little box\nThats the \"Give me back my box\" look.\nThat last shot... \"Where did I go off the tracks? I was gonna be a doctor, ya know? I was gonna help sick kids and travel abroad. Drink milk in Europe, chase mice in Africa, meet a lady cat in Jersey... *sigh* and look at me meow...\" \nWhat breed of cat is this? \nundefined\nMe when i get home from school\nAww. It fits that box and looks so cute &lt;3 I like a simple but clean sleeping place &lt;3\nIt has a heart shaped yawn\nThe original has only got a few hundred views, give them some love on YT! https://youtu.be/VHVC8wcR-fo\n:) \n\u0001F60A\nInside that cat's mouth made my blood crawl. \nIt looked like the Demogorgon when it yawned.\nHoly shit a cat using something that was designed for it to sleep it.

If I could only get my arm inside the... Ah whatever it's fine where it is\nSo... Even if it doesn't fits, its sits? \nIf I fits I sits\nCute but the video has more cuts than a shootout in a budget action movie.\nIf I fits I sits.\nHisco needs bigger box\nMaru has a challenger\nCute\nBonsai cat..\nThat's a cute lil floof\nThis is gonna be the next big cat of youtube. Well deserved, I can't understand how is he so fluffy and plushy and cute and damn those green eyes!\nWhat a pitiful face!\nHow satisfying to watch, I love how this kitten is almost too big for the box hahah\nits very interesting\nThought it was transforming into Fizzgig for a second there! \nOmg so round. \nHe does not fit. \nI felt like I could be a cat.\nI realized that I am a cat after I learned that /r/toomanypillows is a thing.\nChubby cheeks barely fit into that crate.\nStupid cat!\nHmm why does \"If I fits I sits\" seem to ring.\nHosico needs a nice, big cat bed.\nBox kitty. \nHosico needs to overcome his body-size denial and get a larger bed.\nWhat type of cat is Hosico?\nHosico needs a bigger box. :p\nIf I sits I fits\nWhat breed his Hosico?﻿\nseriously, what manner of cat is this?\nwhy do cats always like to go into a box?\n\"If i fit, i sit, then sleep\" ZzZzZz\nHosico is like me. .\nIf I fit, I sit... \nI feel like Maru vs Hosico is going to be the new Coke vs Pepsi.\n[Great.](http://imgur.com/bLs6FzN) [Now mine wants one.](http://imgur.com/q5pHZEp)\nWhat breed is this? He's adorable. \nOh my sweet one\nThis cat looks like he is dusted with cinnamon!\nEven if I don't quite fits,  I still sits\nWhy is that cats fur look so fluffy and cute, is it the type of cat or is it a product of grooming?\nMy name in Wow is Hocico.

All the bitches love me.\nWANT CORGI\nthis is how we cuddle\n\nfirst you lay down\n\nthen I lay down\n\nand then we snuggle\nJust showed this to my friend and I guess she forgot we're at the library since she \"awwww'd\" very loudly and everyone turned around and gave us the stink eye.\nWell, in an hour I'll be heading home knowing that my son isn't capable of comparing to this level of cuteness.  Well played Corgis..\nThere's no way that lil pup didn't make a bonk sound when he sat\nsmol corgi does a sit\nWhen I got my Great Dane at 11 months, she didn't know how to sit.  Had to have other dogs demonstrate, and then push and pull her until she was in the right shape.  Like, she didn't get that the back half can touch the ground while the front half stayed up in the air.  \"It can do that??\"\nThis is by far the highlight of my week. Adorable. Intelligent. Adorable\nGive a dog a treat, train him how to sit. Teach a dog how to train a dog...\nI looked for Ein during every episode of \"COWBOY BEEBOP\" and Corgis are still one of my favorite dogs!\nCorgis. The Twinkies of the dog world.\nEverything about this is why I want a corgi \nThat's corgieous.\nI fucking love dogs more than any person I will ever come across in my lame existence\nhere pupper let me teach you how to be a doggo\nCorgis are the little people of the dog world. \nCorgis are crazy intelligent. My buddy has one and I swear to god it can understand our conversations.\nJust saw this on the frontpage and read shit, was kind of disappointed when the gif was over and he just lay down....\nMuch sitting very sat\n\"Sit down, boi.\"\n\n\"Goodboi.\"\n2cute4me\nAwwww i love corgis\nOmg those stumps\nCorgis don't sit, they sploot. \nAre they praying to goddo before that altar?\nLast time this was posted I thought there was a consensus that the mature dog was trying to mount the little one...\nundefined\nOkay so I know this is off topic and probably been discussed before but I really don't understand how a post has 2300 upvotes and only 40 comments... that's a lot of lurkers\nI don't know what I could add to the conversation. The idea that \"Corgis are friggin cute\" has been more than adequately expressed.\nI know, I know. Let me be amazed, c'mon don't take this away from me!\nDon't forget the the 1:10:100 ratio; for everyone who actually *participates* (votes), there are 100x more pageviews from unregistered users. So it's actually 0.017% of people who see this that have something to say!\n\n(And really, there's not much to say other than \"this is cute!\" or \"my dog does this!\" or some variant thereof).\nYeah, you are right. I'm dead sober and have used reddit for years but it still fucks with my head. The numbers are just so different and when I saw this post earlier it had 2k upvotes and 20 comments which is why I noticed.\nThat's a Karma vein right there! \nundefined\nActually, I thought this was very clever.  The adult dog wants to sit and rest after bouncing around with a puppy all day, but doesn't want the puppy to walk away, so he got the puppy to sit when the puppy still thought this was a game, and then the adult dog sits, because, you know, being a parent is tiring.  More than half way through, haven't seen this observation yet, so my \"Boy are my dogs tired.\" comment just waits, unused.\nundefined\noh god... overload\nSo...much...fluff.\n\n\nthat's so fucking cute \nBut can you teach me how to doggie? \nI wonder if the little one asked him to...\n\nTeach him how to doggie?\nCan I have a corgi pls?\nundefined\n",

No sense of humour at all.\nAwww\npoor kitty, my cats always got a tiny fluffy blanket to cuddle with them\nundefined\nBut, he DOES look like he has pretty fresh bref.\nThey sent my cat home from surgery with a bandana that actually had \"I was very brave\" printed on it. \nNo, Henri, you weren't.

I just don't understand!\n/r/wheredidthesodago\nundefined\nundefined\nMy mom's dog chewed up a plush toy once while she was being boarded at the vet. Our vet knew it was her favorite toy, so he took it to \"surgery,\" giving it real stitches, and sent it home with a tiny cone around it's head.\nI wish I could see this. Sounds cute. \nMy kitten is getting neutered on the 28th. For some reason my husband and I have been using code around him and saying he's going to get tutored. We did it with the dog too. I know how it started but I'm kind of ashamed we keep doing it. We're 37 and 42.\nWhen my parents had their dog, my mom bought her a doggie bed for Christmas one year. She actually hesitated to bring it into the house because she didn't want to walk by the dog and let her see it before Christmas. She had thought about asking the cashier to put it in something you can't see through, but realized that might come off just a tad weird.\nThat makes total sense, though. If I were to bring a dog bed in this house and my dog saw it he would grab for it. I mean he'd grab it so he could rip the stuffing out because he's a fuckweasel but he'd still get excited and grab for it.\nHahaha, \"fuckweasel.\" I like that word X-D\n/u/EvilAndPuissant coined it years ago. I use it as often as possible.\nPartial credit to Stephen King, one day I just needed something stronger than shit weasel. \nundefined\nI have to spell out the word \"treat\" rather than say it because otherwise the cats will go bugfuck. \nMy husband has to say \"MacArthur!\" as he's heading to the door because the dog has learned, \"I shall return!\" means he's leaving.\nOkay, that is fucking brilliant!!\nMine is, \"Arnie!\" (All be bock.)\nClearly, I have got to get more creative! Because y'all are smart as hell. \nMy boyfriend and I \"hide\" things from our dog all the time. We don't say \"We're going to the groomer\" since he doesn't like it-- we say \"We need to set up an appointment with Lori.\"\n\nSomehow it makes me feel like a better mother.\nI have a sneaking suspicion that my dog is mentally broken because we have to lie about taking our FIV+ cats tot he vet. He sees us getting them in the carrier or mentioning the vet and he gets excited. He *loves* the vet and would cheerfully spend an entire day there.\nundefined\nIt's from a classic _The Far Side_.\n&gt; I know how it started\n\n...\nmy brain put a \"don't\" in there for some reason\n\nnever trust your brain\nI've never trusted my brain. \nYou should try to trust your brain. It is looking out for you even when you are not. \nundefined\nI don't trust your brain either.\nNo one should. I once got drunk and wanted s'mores. I lit a friend's shed on fire to do it.

How old is that little munchkin?￼\nAbout three months or just under in this photo, a little older now! Still just as fluffy\nEnjoy it while it lasts. Kittens are the best. \nyes it is \nPuppers run them close!\nWhat's a- No, don't fall into the trap.\nA SMALL DOGGO!\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nBillions of years old, it's the cat deity of cuteness \nSo cute. Just kind the fluff face\nMy cat looked like that when he was tiny. Now he puts his butt inches away from our face and slaps us with his tail to wake us up.  \nThey grow up so fast.\nYou have a denim pillow?\nI don't know if that would be super swanky or really uncomfortable?\nWell, I am biased. I have one pair of jeans. One pillow. So to have a denim pillow? That cannot feel good on your face. My brain is boggled.\nMaybe it's some sort of special fancy pillow denim that is softer than regular old pants denim. I simply don't know enough about denim...\nOr maybe it's just a denim design.\nI mean, some jeans can feel really comfy. And jean jackets were/are a pretty popular thing. Personally I don't think they look that comfortable (looks stiff if you ask me) but maybe they feel amazing. No clue... \nDenim can be surprisingly comfortable both as a jacket and a pillow.\nundefined\nmaybe the kitten is really small and we are zoomed in enough to see the individual fabric threads.\nundefined\nMy parents' have a denim couch in their basement and it is by far the comfiest couch I have ever experienced. 10/10 would recommend.\nBut is it some sort of special denim? From some premium denim cattle or something?\nYes, from fine highland Swedish demin cattle\nI'm sorry I didn't realize I gave off the impression that I'm poor. My family doesn't own some cheep Swedish denim. Our couch is made from the worlds' finest cattle. Located on the Japanese island of Shikoku, buddhist monks individually mentor a single Denimu ushi. The Denimu ushi is the only known being that we have witnessed achieve Nirvana. Once said Nirvana is reached they're life force is turned into a couch. \nundefined\nundefined\nThat's a selvedge pillow idiot, it's Japanese so it must be good\nundefined\nHaha... It's just blue!\nWell yeah denim is traditionally blue.\nJillow\nThat fabric looks like chambray. \nI have a denim comforter. It's actually really soft and very different from pant denim. Plus it got softer over the years as it got worn in, and it's lasted a pretty long time (I think I've had it for close to 10 years now?) I wouldn't want it as a pillow though.\nFound it on the beach. Dont worry Its boiled tho\nWe boil all of our denim\nI had a soft denim pillow. kind of rough and soft at the same time \nundefined\nFor some reason the term Denim Pillow reminds me of Reba. \n\nOh that Barbara Jean is just hilarious. \nundefined\n*If its not too much trouble...I would like some nom noms hooman*\n\n&lt;1 year later&gt;\n\n*HOOOOMAN! HOOOOMAN!  It's 5 minutes past 6am.  Where's my fucking Meow Mix? And my poop sand needs sifting*\n\n\nMan, I wish my cat waited until 6 am to start his daily breakfast yowl.\nMine must be defective. He waits until I'm awake. \nI would tell you to bring it back to the cat factory, but there is an highg risk of you returning home with more cats than you went in.\n\nIt is not worth it, so you will have to keep your defective cat.\nAnd I read: \n&gt;Mine must be detective \nGet a clue...\nNo shit, Sherlock.\nundefined\nundefined\nI accidentally Pavlov'ed my cats into figuring out that the kibble will absolutely never flow until my specific alarm goes off. Then, the minute it does, the ritual begins where they both start purring aggressively while one sprawls across my shoulders and the other one kneads my ankles.\nThat's an awesome alarm!!\nMy cat gets fed then must think I'm stupid because she acts like I didn't just feed her so I'll give her more \nMy two cats play this game with every person in the house. We got one of those magnetic weekly calendars and two magnets. When the cats are fed in the morning, one magnet gets moved to that day of the week, in the evening, the second magnet is placed. \n\nWe had to do this because the little bullshitters were succeeding in tricking us into believing that they hadn't been fed, and were getting fat. \nMy wife's cat does this. When I get up at 4:30am for work I feed the cats. When the wife gets up, she is right at her feet bitching and moaning like she hasnt been fed in weeks.\nI have four... One of which knows if he starts ripping up paper or magazines i will wake up and feed him.  And then he will eat two bites and complain about the food.  \nI have six. One used to wake up my mother at the early hours by jumping on the handle of her room's door and opening it/repeating till she opened it.\n\nI removed the handle. After three days of jumping and confused/frustrated meowing, she stopped.\nShould probably stop rewarding that behavior. I would get a small kennel and put him in it when he starts to do that. \nundefined\nSame here...four cats, and the three girls will eat dry at night but the boy requires my can-opening skills. If I leave an extra bowl out when I go to bed, he wakes me around 4 a.m. to mix the food so the gravy's back on top.\nMine stays silent until I put my foot on the floor, but before that, he eats my hair and licks my face until I'm awake.\nMe too. 5am is a luxury...\nOne of mine usually will meow randomly throughout the day , and will do it at night too. Usually right as my husband and I are trying to fall asleep, or at 2 am.\nLuckily, ours loves my husband so he has to get up most of the time!\nMy cats get fed around sunset around 5.45 pm but\nIf it's been raining and it's dark they allways think it's dinner time even if it's just 4pm\nCrazy cats ;)\nMine gets her wet food at 5pm but if you're in the kitchen at 4:30 she gets antsy. \ni thnk that too\nFeed him right when you leave for the morning instead of right when you get up. Apparently this helps. \nundefined\nPoop sand \u0001F4A9\nI vow to you here today that I will only call kitty litter 'poop sand' until I am no longer able to speak.\nWill you also sing the poop sand song every time your cat has to poop? \nOh wise sir, please teach us the words of said song.\nOh, the poop sand has chunkies, the poop sand has stink... the poop sand has odors that drive ye to drink.    When the poop sand needs shiftin with yon slotted scoop, go enter ye bravely and shift out the poop!\nOh the poop sand! It won't shift itself.  Oh the poop sand! Some times gets refilled!  Now be a good hooman and enter the fray.  Go shift kitteh's poop sand, get on it, okay.\nLmao! I don't know why but I imagined Merry and Pip from LOTR singing this while swinging and spilling pint glasses on a tavern table.\nAaaaaaand saved\n*I've traveled 5 leagues yonder since I heard a prophet tell of a cat poop ballad. May we hear your angelic sounds?*\nundefined\nYeah. I thought the keyword was waits. When we first got my kitty when he wanted something he would put his little paw on your hand or leg and stair up at you with puppy dog eyes. Now that he is older and more confidante with us, he just jumps on our laps or stomachs and just starts screaming. \nThe cats my ex's confidante too, usually after a bottle of wine. \n&gt;The cat is my ex's confidante too, usually after a bottle of wine. \n\nFTFY because it took me a long time to understand the sentence. \nundefined\nI put my cats in time out of they talk too much about food.\nWhen I first got mine, she used to politely poke me in the ribs or face to wake me up when shes hungry. Now she just sings the song *\"It's 6am, bitch feed me\"*\nSuch a devil in disguise!\nThat made me nearly fall of my seat out of laughter while reading this in the bus\nIt is waiting for the master to accompany it to play with it\nundefined\nFAKE. No cat *waits* for you to get up. They either stomp on your face, start kneading your most tender, unprotected bits or proceed to yell at you in kitten speak to use your puny human self to fetch the food, *now dammit*.\nI had a cat that would, he was the best. He was always there sleeping next to me when I went to sleep and woke up. Patiently waiting for cuddling and food. He was a big guy too. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/eVydZ\n\nSame here. She's now five. If her bowl is empty she'll wait in bed next to me for me to wake up. Not to mention that in 9 out if 10 times she'll fall asleep, often times sleeping longer than I am. So in the end she's basically woken by me making her breakfast. \n\nOn the other hand, my tomcat that I grew up with as a kid used to pet my face to try to wake me at 6 am. I have a pretty good sleep which is why he stopped after a while. Instead, he'd wake up next to me, go wake my mom, have his breakfast and crawl back to me in bed. I've never known this until he was already gone. My mom told me that he'd always sleep in my arm, get up in the morning but return before I woke up. I never realized he left for a good hour in the morning since he was always in my arm when I woke up for school. Best buddy ever. \nI had really hard times waking up/getting out of the bed when I was a kid. \nMy mom got annoyed getting me up during school weeks, so she let our cat do the job for her. She would just open my room door and let the cat in, which usually already was waiting to get in. She jumped on my bed and immediately stated petting my hands/head until I would play with her. \n\nDunno if that shortened the time getting up in the end, but I defenetly got up happy.\n\nEdit\n\nOk reddit, I know your filthy mind. Of course the cat jumped in my bed, not my mom..\nOn the rare occasions my cats let me sleep in, the one's preferred spot is where the blanket pools between my legs *cough crotch*. Many a morning I've sent her flying off the side when I roll over trying to find the cool spot on the pillow.[Exhibit A: Crotch Kitten](http://imgur.com/N831bhz.jpg)\nThe sole purpose of the human crotch is to provide a warm cozy spot for sleepy time.\n\nAnd for breeding feeder ape slaves.\nCan confirm. This is my cat's favorite sleeping spot too, and she is STUBBORN about it. She'll come back no matter how many times I roll over and accidentally dump her off the bed, or try to gently move her.\n\nThe twist: now I'm so used to it, I have trouble sleeping without her. When she decides to sleep on my bf or next to our bed instead, I wonder wtf I did wrong that day.\nundefined\nFor you.\nQpad - I like you already. What kind of wedding cake should we have, something fancy or just kladdkaka?\nKladdkaka ftw\n\nEdit: ftw not frw\nundefined\nMine always waited too, slept beside me and wouldn't get up until I did. Only times she ever woke me up was if there wasn't enough room for her to sleep beside me and she wanted me to scooch over so she could snuggle in.\n\"Was\"? :(\nSo beautiful . . . sorry he has left you, but you will see him again .. . \nCat and a mechanical keyboard... Bold move there.\nundefined\nAnd if that does not help, they start eating your feet. \nOne of the kittens my cat had would wake me up by climbing up the blinds and then jumping on my face. I'd say it was a good 4 foot drop kick. \n\nThe first time it happened I freaked out and sprung upwards which sent the poor thing spinning through the air. I felt really bad because I didn't mean it (was just a reaction) but at the same time the little screech it made while performing a perfect triple side flip made me laugh pretty hard (but only because it didn't get hurt). It actually wound up landing on its feet at the edge of my bed. \n\nThat little fucker did that every night until I finally took the blinds down. I would have just kept him out of my room but he was just too damn cute and cuddly... And if the door was shut he would meow until I opened it. \nI had one that did. Mind you, this was after I trained her to not a) sleep on my head because she loved me so much and b) not try and groom me all night because she loved me so much. I imagine she spent all night on the pillow next to my head gazing adoringly at me.\n\nShe was the best cat.\nOh god... that reminds me when i was a kid I woke up thinking i was blind.... nope just my black kitty sleeping on my face. Normally he slept around my neck or on my hair so the new position plus morning brain fog == blindness.\nMy cat does.  He waits until I'm starting to wake up and then I'm cuddling a cat.  It's awesome. \nMine does this, she waits for movement then jumps up into bed and snuggs against my ribs while I rub her belly\nAnd you know, the fact that you can't take a picture while sleeping\nNot with that attitude. \nPlease do not give her ideas\nMy cats have also figured out that the scale will make a beeping noise if they sit on it. Somehow this compels the human. \nMy cat always has food in his bowl. Instead, he likes to wake me at 5:30 AM because he's awake so that means everyone needs to be awake.\nYeah, my cat has a bowl which autodispenses food on a regular schedule. This will never stop her from waking me up just to amuse her.\nundefined\nMine waits. Though she started to loudly play with her toys starting around 5 a.m., even bring them on the bed to play at our feet. We have to hide all her toys every night. \nMy cat waits.\nyour cat is broken. \nundefined\nEverything about that kitten is painfully adorable.\nSo cute it hurts. \nThat is one adorable kitty the eyes and whiskers. It's like the cat version of the pretty people that come in picture frames when you buy them.\nHaha. I always call especially cute cats \"Calendar Cats.\" The kind you'd find posing in baskets for calendars.\nWhen she's a bit older and finds out she is the center of the universe, she'll sit on your face waiting until you choke yourself awake.\nHow can you sleep when you have such a cute little kitty????? \nA cat that *waits* for you to wake up? Are you sure it's a cat?\n\nMine would either plug my nostrils with his paws or purr like he had a corvette engine with straight pipes.\nA cat that doesn't wake you up is not a cat\nWaits? My one cat will literally sprint back and forth just behind our heads on the pillows a couple times until we wake up super confused as to why our heads are bouncing up and down like mother fuckers.\nMy cat has also mastered more subtle wakeup methods like prodding noisy objects like bottles or bags.\ni wonder if she realises that she sleeps too or she thinks she's living in some nightmarish world where all the smoothskins drop dead for hours at a time. that'd stress me out if i didn't know what was going on.\nGod I wish that's how my cat was. He's a terrorist that knocks my alarm clock onto my sleeping face.\nWhen my boy was this tiny he insisted on sleeping on our chests. It was SO CUTE but also nerve wracking, lol. I couldn't sleep very deeply for a while. \nAwww. Mine just punches me repeatedly in the face until I wake up.\nI thought I was the only one\nI woke up to this one morning.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ry6Gpc7.jpg\nundefined\nMy cat figures out how to get what she wants.  (In Kitty Speak)\n\n \"If you don't feed me then I will just have to go up to this incedibly expensive CPAP machine and starting playing with it..... What COULD I do with this air hose!\" \n\n I've got a bad hip but it takes me about two seconds to get out of bed.\nWait...hold up. Your cat -waits- for you to get up?\nMy kitten just takes a shortcut right across your head\nI think your cat is defective.  Cats don't wait for you to wake up.  They wake you up.\n\"I pooped in ur sheets.\"\nGoddamn that's cute!\nDogs see you as their god because you are the one who feed them. Cats think they are your god because you feed them.\nMy cat did that every day when she was younger as well. And she looks exactly like yours!\nMine did too. Now he worms his way under the covers and attacks our feet. \nShe has gorgeous eyes.\nWhat an impossibly adorable kitten! Freaking gorgeous cuteness!\npretty colors!\nOnce you make eye contact it's game over.\nWell mine shoved her soggy nose in my ear. Fuck you for having such a gorgeous and sweet cat.\nYou're so lucky she waits! Mine starts clawing your face\nNice. My cat just screams at me until I wake up.\nThose eyes. Oh dear god I'd never leave for work. \nEhh... That's not true. Adorable cat though right there\nplease stop...\nMythril +10\n\nDeath = guanteed\nHow the fuck did you get a cat that WAITS for you to wake up instead of just pouncing on you? Also, cute Kitty!\nI doubt it, but it's a gorgeous kitty so have an up jellybean.\nComing from a cat lover, seeing this picture made me realize why many people who surround themselves or spend too much time with cats end up going crazy.\nfucking god damn fucking cute that is. \nShe's beautiful, I miss having a little one around the house.\nShe looks a little scared, like she didn't know what to do with herself until you open your eyes. Beautiful kitty for sure!\nEvery day she is prob like are they dead? Are they dead? Phew. They are alive. \nlucky you, my cat will stick his head through the curtains to make sure we are blinded by sunlight while going MIAAAAAAAAOOOOOOO... or he comes and sits on my head.\nundefined\nPicture is fake, as soon as I creak open my eyes, my cat claws my face to death wanting attention, and food...not necessarily in the same order.\nThe innocence of this picture is what will blind us when kittens take over the world!\nI highly doubt she *always~~a~~* waits like that. \n\nBecause that is just too adorable to handle on a daily basis.\nCute AF OP.\n\nStay cute kitty\nSo much cuter than my little kitty cat. \n\nI woke up to a butt on my chin this morning. \nOh, you woke up again, you had me worried.\nOh my goodness. It would be worth it to get up in the morning. Those eyes are mesmerizing.\nMy cat wakes me up every morning at 0545 by painfully licking my back and armpits.  What a douche. \nSo she wakes you up by giving you heart attacks from cuteness overload. Got it.\nShe wishes she were bigger so she could kill you.  \n\nhttp://theoatmeal.com/misc/frame/cat_kill\nA cat that waits for you to wake up? \n\nEgad, you've found the fabled Impossible Cat of Katmandu. \nHer eyes are gorgeous!\nMust.

This couldn't be more true. A neighbor kid had ferrets growing up. Their house smelled terrible. Cute little slinky rats though.\n&gt; neighbor kid\n\nThis is the real problem here. It all depends on who's taking care of them - if it's some 13 year old that never cleans their cage / bedding, feeds them the wrong food, and over/under bathes them, they're gonna smell. The reason the \"smelly ferret\" myth is so prevalent is because most people's only experience with ferrets is like yours with the neighbor kid.\n\nThe truth is that if you're a responsible pet owner and can handle 15 - 30 minutes of cage maintenance a day, the smell is less than that of a cat. I've had countless people over at my apartment since I've had my ferrets and no one's complained about the smell. In fact, some people were even surprised to find out I had ferrets. Like with any pet, it all comes down to the owner. For me, I've had several different kinds of pets over the years but ferrets have been my favorite by far. Pic for science: http://imgur.com/a/nfOSd\nDo they bond with you? And anything that makes them hard to own? Such as they chew stuff, use the restroom everywhere, etc.?\nThey're not the easiest pet to own but not the hardest either. While most of the time they won't chew on wires or random things, you should always watch them when you let them out. They are insanely curious and highly intelligent so they will get into absolutely anything and everything. Nothing is too high for a ferret to climb or too tight for them to squeeze into. They also have a tendency to knock things over to take a look into them.\n\nYou can litter train them like cats but at their best they're only around 75% accurate. Mine go back in their cage most of the time but if they're feeling lazy / just woke up from a nap, sometimes they use the nearest corner. You could potentially solve this problem by putting litter boxes in every corner but I haven't bothered since mine aren't that bad about it.\n\nAs far as bonding goes, they definitely form a bond of their own even if it's not quite like a cat or a dog. They're definitely more independent and autonomous than most domestic animals. It might take a while to get used to their personalities, but I've found that it helps to explain their behavior if you think of them as little people. They're incredibly entertaining to own and probably one of the cutest / coolest pets you can legally have. They're totally unlike any other pet I've had, and I've had a few.\n\nPS; if you're seriously considering getting a ferret, check in over at /r/ferrets for some good info. In particular, make sure to look at the kibble comparison chart to get them quality food if you decide to get them - so many people feed their ferrets undigestable food that cuts their lifespan in half.\nundefined\nI know you have to be careful with ovens and dishwashers because they'll slink themselves in there and kill themselves\nCan confirm: had a ferret die in a dishwasher when I was a kid. RIP Rocky\nundefined\nMy house is already smelly. So... win win?\nNow you have an excuse!\nundefined\nI live in a pretty small apartment and my roommates have two ferrets. There isn't a smell, outside of being really close to their cage (and even then it's not a strong smell). There's a lot of stuff out there now that does a good job eliminating the smell.\nundefined\nDon't they smell, or is that weasels?\nFerrets stink pretty bad. \nMost that are pets have had their scent glands removed.  We had 3 (all descented - how they came, not by us) and the smell was comparable to a cat.\n\nWe changes their litterpans daily and never had any comments about the smell.  If we left their litter for more than 2 days or so it would obviously get stinky.\n\nWe have just one left and we only change his litter once or twice a week now, and when you walk into his room you don't even smell him.\n\nThe smell thing is definitely dependant on your own care of them and whether they have their glands or not.  Never dealt with or smelled ferrets with their glands but I could imagine a strong musk.\n&gt;when you walk into his room…. \n\nThat's one privileged otter!\n2 bedroom apartment, double income no kids :p\nHuh, I never even thought of that - scent gland removal - as an option, but it makes a lot of sense. I can't think of any downsides since it's not like they're ever going to need them if you don't release them into the wild.\nFrom what we can tell it doesn't seem to impact them.  But I'm not a vet and couldn't say for sure.  We had 3 very happy little carpet sharks that all got heartily sized and were active &amp; affectionate.\nSo do otters. It's like a hot barn sort of stench.\nundefined\nundefined\nUntil they chew an infants face off\n\nEdit: I understand that is isn't as common as I once thought. Excuse my bias ferret lovers \nDoes.. does that happen?\nYou'd have to have a very special ferret and a very unattended child, but I'm sure it *could* happen, in the same way that your pomeranian could kill an infant too.\n\nIt's not within the usual temperament, and is unlikely to happen without significant other behavioral issues in the animal. It's also not likely to happen unless you leave your child completely unattended in the presence of them for a long time. Mostly the ferrets will play with a kid and then get bored. As if the ferret way with all things.\nThey get bored, find a corner, and leave a massive pile of shit up against it. \nSometimes it's longer than the ferret.\nJust like with any other neglected pet left alone with a small child.\nnot more so than when dogs do it.\nundefined\nThat baby *was* being a dick, in fairness...\nundefined\nundefined\nYep, perfectly fine and [cud-](http://www.slightlywarped.com/crapfactory/curiosities/2014/march/images/otter_vs_alligator_05.jpg)... [Oh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01iWx4476pY)\n\nNever mind, that shit's the stuff of nightmares. Especially the sound.\nTo be fair, those are giant river otters. That's like saying cats are bad because a puma will rip your face off. \nIt sounded like demonic children chanting as they killed it!\nWtf. That sound.\nAs with every other wild animal?\nundefined\nAs long as you don't let the otter near your pet baby seal they're fine pets.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGeXr18M6ew\nundefined\nThe problem is that it's not just about money and space for an appropriate enclosure.  You also have to take into account specific dietary needs, enrichment (mental and physical stimulation and activities that are appropriate for that animal), as well as vet care (most vets are not willing or even remotely able to take care of animals that are non standard pets (hell it's hard enough finding vets for common pet birds, ferrets, hedgehogs...).  Add in the fact that in many places there are strict laws about what animals you can and can't keep as pets.  Sure you can think \"who will find out\", but imagine your special pet getting injured or ill.  You're already worried and then you finally find a vet who is able to even begin to treat an animal like yours and you go in only to find out that the animal is illegal for you to have and the vet has to confiscate the animal (and in many cases put it down).  SO then you have to consider whether you will let a sick or injured animal suffer or risk if you can find a vet who won't report the animal and take it away and who will be able to treat it without accidentally killing it because of some special need of that particular animal the vet isn't familiar with.  \n\nThen you have issues with how many people are just willing to toss out their pets when they get bored or annoyed with taking care of them (and otters are very high energy so need lots of attention that many people wouldn't be able to handle (if you ever need proof look through craigslist, facebook, /r/pets... for how many people are willing to just get rid of an animal because they didn't do their research to understand its needs)) so then you start having an issue with invasive species in your area (take a peak at Florida dealing with snakes and monkeys that have spread because of people releasing pets into the wild).\n\nSo no the average person shouldn't just go for it because they have money to blow on an enclosure. \nundefined\nundefined\n*Need*\nWas here first -_-\nThere are two, you can share. \nNo! x[\nI otter take both of em since yall can't decide.\nundefined\nWish it, want it, do it\nundefined\nFerrets are a good alternative\nundefined\nThat one otter just can't get enough of the magically endless stream of water. \nand the otter one is jealous.  boom!  nailed it!  it just came to me!\n*Wotter sports*\nOtterboarded\nundefined\n[Sauce.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHHf6G6sVtE)\nSource, in case anyone ctrl+Fs for that. \nAt this point I ctrl+f \"sauce\" before \"source\"... \n[sauce](http://i.imgur.com/lLtdSb0.jpg)\nundefined\nI was wondering why someone would wash an otter...\n- because asia\n- because cute\nundefined\nI get a similar reaction when washing my ferrets.\nWell these are just hydro-ferrets anyway.

Now I've already had my dose cringe for the day. \nundefined\nIt's always sort of ironic. \nHow so?\nDon't ya think?\n90's reference. Nice!\nundefined\nundefined\nI'm talkin bout that fedora wearin\n ***Woo!***\nRepost submittin \n***Woo!***\nNo-life, karma sucking loser.... you know JUST who I'm talkin bout and I'm just getting started \n***Woooooo!***\nand more behaved\n\nwith better manners\nDefinitely a better boy than some as well \nundefined\nundefined\nA lot of redditors. I'm constantly reminded how old I am when I browse this site.\nundefined\n*Shiiiit*\nYep, dogs do that; don't forget to scoop \nI'm 17, maybe he's my dog soul mate\nI'm 22, don't bang dogs.\nAs a 31 y/o, can confirm. \n46... My intact Great Pyr tries to bang me on occasion, does that count?\nundefined\nYoung ogre ?\nThis doggo is as old as me\nundefined\nWow!  Congrats to wonderful old doggie!\nWow, that's really great! Congrats indeed. 17 is a wonderful age a lot of dogs won't get. And the dog is still very beautiful and looks healthy! \nMy childhood dog lasted until 22\n\nShe was a princess :&lt;\nWow, that's really amazing! I hope she grew old in a healthy and good way. Dogs are awesome! \nWell, she was put down after she went blind. Even still, while she was blind she was very dignified, barking under her breath if there was an object in front of her.\n:)\nundefined\n[deleted]\nundefined\nHoly fuck, she outlived most cats\nI know, right? I honestly believe it was because my Nan would give her a cup of tea and a biscuit at 3pm. And if the cuppa and biccie was late you'd blood know about it. Also, my Nan would cook the dog a nice chicken dinner every so often.  \n  \nThinking back about it my Nan put more effort into the dogs dinner than mine.\nI like the way you talk ...\nundefined\nMy lovely girl died last year at the age of 10, after half a year of sickness. I miss her because she has helped me through quite a lot and I regret every single time I didn't appreciate her the way she deserved it (ya know, stupid teenager and shit).\nI have felt the same about pets in the past but you must remember she loved you unconditionally and definitely felt the love back :)\nYeah. I remember seeing a list of things dogs would tell us if they could and the one that gave me the feels was \"Stay with me because you make everything easier for me, even my own death\". I'm glad I was able to stay with her during her last hours to comfort her, even if it hurts.\nMy dog would say \"GIVE ME THE FUCKING BROOM, BARK BARK RUFF GRR\"\n.....man you have no idea how much that just ruined my day...\n\nah well.\nundefined\nOnly 90's dogs will get this. \nundefined\nundefined\nOne of the few remaining 20th century woofs \nWow... Haven't thought of that!\nOf of the only dogs from the first 2 millenia\nWoof! Haven't thought of that! \nFTFY\nOnly 90's dogs remember\nNow I wanna know how many 20th century foxes there are left! \nConsidering their average lifespan is 5, I'd say probably zero. Or *maybe* one.\nThere can only be one!\nD:\n&gt; Drive D does not exist! \n   You must mount it first. Type intro or intro mount for more information.`\n(http://imgur.com/fj9H06c\n\nI also have a 17 year old dog!\nAw all the white! Almost looks like mine just smaller. Here's to many more happy days!\nWish I had a puppy picture. He was all black on his face except a white streak right down his nose to the top of his head. \n\nI just went and saw him. He's doing good\n[this](http://m.imgur.com/BHO6jjC?r) is him as a pup. Happy to hear he's doing well!\nundefined\nWow\nThose 90s models were built of strong stuff. I myself have a '96 meow that's still purring along nicely.\nWe have a grand total of one 20th century meow at the cat shelter I work at. Her 17th birthday is actually a week from today!\nundefined\nI know that feel. My lifelong died a couple years back and it still makes me sad. His name was Wizard and he was born 5 days before me. He died a couple weeks before our 18th birthdays, and on Christmas.\n\nEdit: The feel of having a wonderful dog for so long.\nLoving my pups even more so than normal tonight for wizard!\nWizard was great. The only cake he got was when he ate a whole chocolate cake when no one was looking at age 3.\n\nLove them while you can.\nLost our little girl a few months back. We had just booked a cruise to dovetail into Thanksgiving. It was a hard day.\n\nI'd drop the cruise in a heartbeat to get 4 paws back in this house.\n\n\nMy family border collie mix Murphy, died 3 years ago. He made it to 17. The last year or so he didn't have the strength to play, but was happy. Then the day before we had to put him down, he found the energy to play (short distance) fetch. It took a lot of effort to not tear up. He was the kind of dog that would sense when you were sad.\n\nI miss him. He was a good boy.\nundefined\nWow, that's a remarkably long life for a big dog.  Happy birthday to your pup!\nDo you have a picture of it when it was a youngster? Super cute. Looks just like mine. \nI do! I'll post it tomorrow he used to be solid black \nRemindMe! 18 hours\nI got you fam! I'll remind you in exactly 60 days! \nRemindMe! 60 days\nSure bro! I'll remind you in exactly 18 hours!\nundefined\nundefined\nRemindMe! 20 hours\nRemindMe! 24 hours\nundefined\nOh yeah, I would love to see that too!\nRemindMe! 24 hours\n[in his youth ](http://imgur.com/V7btbkC) \n[as a pup](http://imgur.com/Q00HBOK) \nundefined\n[puppers](http://i.imgur.com/BHO6jjC.jpg) \nundefined\n\"Thank you yes but I heard something about steak?\"\nAw hahah he eats better than my other dogs because he has been sick the last year and it helps him take his meds \nMay I ask what he has?  I have an almost 16 year old dog with IBD (she could be a year old but I adopted her so it's an unknown).  She got sick last year but we manage with meds and home cooking.  Edit:  Happy birthday, old boy!  You're looking good and your human is lucky to have you so long.\nHe has a few tumors growing and is on pain meds till he passes. You can't tell he's in pain though he'll still play with my other dog just sometimes has a hard time getting up on the bed or seeing \nundefined\nI love dogs. They're so faithful, always with us through thick and thin. I wish your dog a long, long life with lots of happiness to come!\nundefined\nhttp://i.imgur.com/I1XVT49.gif\n\"Bitch, this foods on fire! What's wrong with you?\"\nundefined\nLive long pupper\nLive long and pupper.\nPup-sper\nBy dog standards, he already has though.\nBut now he's a doggo\nAll doggos are puppers.\nBut then we must ask ourselves. What truly is, a pupper? \nA small doggo\nundefined\nundefined\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY YOU PURE SOUL Bork Bork \nCongrats! My family dog turned 17 in July. I'm pretty sure he's blind, deaf and got dementia but he's a happy little thing! \nSame here, although we're not sure of her exact birth date because we kinda rescued her... She is for sure deaf and probably has dementia, but still gets so happy. \n\nDoesn't handle the stairs so well anymore though which is sad but I don't care to give her a carry. :)\nUnlike high school freshman; your dog remembers 9/11. That blows my mind more than it should. I need some sleep. \nMeanwhile I'm 19 and I don't remember 9/11.\n\nWe crossed that bridge long ago I'm afraid...\n\nEdit: Born in 1997 for reference, so I was 4 years old at the time.\nYour not helping. Now I know there are adults walking around that don't remember 9/11. \nI can legally drink (in the UK), star in porn and drive a car.\n\nI don't consider myself emotionally mature or *really* an adult, if that makes you feel any better.\nI'm 24. The fact that I am considered an adult still amazes me, and I still do a double take when someone tries to get my attention by calling me \"sir\".\nIKR? I think the \"adult\" badge should be 25+ tbh...\n\nI have no idea how to survive on my own!\nHappy birthday pup! I hope you got all the pets and treats today. \nundefined\nLooking great at 17.  Happy birthday doggy!\nHappy Birthday to your lovely pupperdoggo\nAww happy happy birthday to you, you gorgeous thing!\nWhen my girl turned one, i made her  steak and baked potato with party  hats.  I can still see her grin.  \nLive Long and Pupper\nthat's awesome. party on, dude! \nWonderful years together.\nDoesn't look a day over 15\nReminds me of Chief from The Fox and The Hound but more adorable.\nThat dog looks amazing! Happy B day give a dog a bone \nundefined\nGet 17 candles you cheap fuck\nHappy birthday!!! My two pups had their first birthday party today complete with pupcakes!\nWow, 17.  That's amazing.\nHappy birthday fella! Looking sharp!\nWhat a great looking pup! Happy as can be at the young old age of 17! Here's to many many more wonderful years!\nSuch a cutie! Happy Birthday little one! &lt;3 \nAw tell him we said he's a good boy!!\nWow..thats beautiful...  \nHappy Birthday, young man!\nSweet baby angel \nHappy birthday buddy!\nAww happy birthday old fella! \u0001F497 \u0001F604\nAw pretty dog. Do you know what breed your dog is? If so, would you mind telling me?\nAw thank you! He's a black lab mutt and that's all I know. The other breed was something smaller because he never was larger than 50 lbs\nHappy Birthday Ichiban!  May you have a wonderful day good sir, filled with tummy rubs &amp; ear scratches!  &amp; I want to add that you are a very distinguished gentleman who doesn't look his age at all!  Happy Birthday!!!\nHe looks like a good boy! Have you told him he's a good boy? He's a good boy! Is he a good boy? Good boy!\nThat is amazing to hear! Happy Birthday to your pup! \n\n\nI bet those cupcakes are so good, he just stays alive to have them every year.\nHappy Birthday! Looking great :- )!\nCongrats and I hope he'll be around many more years\nLong live the dog!\nGo give him a kiss and a cuddle. I lost my 15 year old the other day. \n\nHappy birthday though! 17 is awesome!\nLooking good for 17!! Happy birthday, buddy.\nwow, she is blessed and so are you! I had  17 year old dog as well. I recently picked up a puppy and hope to god shes with me for that long.\nMy dogo is 9 and I really hope he lives to 22, that would be amazing. I can't bare to think about being without him.\nYou're missing 118 candles on that cupcake. \nHey man. That's awesome to hear :). Glad to see a dog \"ruff\" it out for 17 years! You must take very good care and he/she must be a very happy dog\ncould have waited on taking the picture after nam flashbacks were done\nHe (I know, I assumed it's gender, I'm scum right) doesn't even look 17! May he live a long healthy life :)\nYou didn't assume anything if you look closely there is proof. \nOmg I love you \n/u/MrPope266 just made me zoom in on a dog dick...\nLike that was your first time \nI do have a male dog...\nundefined\nundefined\nWhat kind of cupcake do you make for a dog, anyway? Vanilla?\nI'm not sure I didn't make it. There's a bakery in my city that makes only stuff for dogs\nI've always wanted to open a store to make dog treats / cakes etc for dogs.  I would call it St. Lucy's Barkery.\n\nAnd happy birthday to puppers!  \nundefined\nNext year you can buy him a beer in Montreal!\nHope I look that good at 119.... actually, I don't want to live that long. :\\\nHappy Birthday ❤\nHey it's my birthday too, your dog and I are exactly the same age.  Happy birthday doggo. \nundefined\nOh no way dude. My dog just turned 2 today! Happy same birthday dog day!\nis that buddy?\nI wonder how many more dogs born in the 90's are still here with us \nAwww. Does this beauty have a name?\nHis name is ichiban \nHappy birthday sweet Ichiban! Love the name. &lt;3\nundefined\n\"My **brother** turned 17 today!\"  \n  \nFTFY\nundefined\nHappy birthday!! \n119 in dog years\n90's pup\nSoooo cute. I love the cupcake idea too, you're probably fun to be around. \n\nHappy Birthday to him!\nYOU ate that cupcake didn't you. . . \nYou're dog looks awesome for that age, congrats!\nSuch a darling. Happy birthday!\nOP i have the same rug as you! My dog pees on it all the time\nCongratulations! Enjoy the day!\nWhat a handsome pup! It shows you took very good care of him. I can only hope mine will last that long too.\nHappy fucking birthday you old dog!\nWoo! Mine is turning 17 on Christmas\nCongrats pupski. What have you fed him ? \nundefined\nOnly 90's dogs will get this.\nWow my dog died at 14 that dog is a REBEL\nBless her fur socks. \nPoppins??\nundefined\nThat is the face of a truly happy dog. \nWhat do you feed him? What is the secret to keeping a dog healthy enough to make it 17years? Ahhh he looks so good! Wtg OP. Happy Birthday Doggo.\nHe always ate just normal dog food and some human food that he was allowed to have. He was walked often but we have a huge yard too. The one thing my family ever did right was a house filled with love. I had a rabbit that lived to be 13 also \nHoly crap your dog lived a long life\nwow next year don't get him cash for his birthday... he'll just spend it all on cigarettes\nExcise me but that is a puppy. Pupper. Puppio\nevery doggo is a pupper but not every pupper is a doggo.\n\\#happy17doggo\nHappy Birthday, Doggie!! ^^\nThis dog is older than the Star Wars prequels.\nLive long and prosper, doggo. \nBork bork you are doing me a celebration. \nThe dog thinks it's looking at the cupcake.\nMy puppy was born around the same time as yours. She passed away about 2.5 years ago. I still miss her so much. Enjoy your time together until the very end. \nFuck!! My dog's birthday was in April (17 yo), she passed away in May. Now I'm almost crying. Congratulations to your dog.\nLove is the reason dogs live this long. As long as they have love they will be healthy, as our Lab was 16.5 when she walked into the hospital for her final walk. I held her hand as she had her final smile, as she had a huge tumour, and now she has peace. Princess is always in our hearts.\nWhat does her diet consist of?\nundefined\nThat dog looks like \"damn human, why do you only remember my birthday every 7 years? \"\nGlad to see your dog made it to 17. I recently (like a day ago) lost my 13 year old dog to a pack of coyotes, so please charish every moment you have with your dog, as it maybe the last. \nThat's a nice Doggo. Still looks like a pupper!\nHappy birthday good dog! I had to out my 16 yr old down earlier this year. Love him everyday!\nI'm so sorry to hear that, I got a dog in my 20's she's 5 now and I can't imagine the day even with this old guy. He is sick and on meds till he passes but looked so happy in this picture I had to post it, for the most part he's always in good spirits just loving him everyday!\nOne of the few remaining dogs born in the 20th century. That's crazy.\nHe is precious!\nHappy birthday, doggo!\nBeautiful old pupper, happy birthday!\nundefined\n",

SERPENTINE!\nBABOU!\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nThat seriously irritated me. There's no reason they couldn't have had him juke and still get nailed. It would have reinforced Ramsay as being *that* dangerous of a bowman.  In the world of ice and fire where life is cheap you'd think people would know that.\n\nI bet millions of people were screaming \"back and forth you dumb shit!!\" when that episode premiered on TV. I know we were. When he was killed there was no sympathy at all, instead he got a collective \"that's what you get for being a tard\".\nOk, to be fair - his just a *kid*. I don't get why everyone is on this case so hard. Kid is probably terrified his about to die and sees his brother running to him?  \nNot like it would have mattered, Ramsy would have nailed him anyway he went. Kid probably knew that much before he even started runnning.\nA kid that was raised in the wild, by a wildling, since he was like 3.

It looks synchronized even though the cheetah has to see the jukes first and then react yet I can't notice any delay.\nundefined\nThat gif has managed to instill the terror of cheetahs into me moreso than any other I've seen. \n[Here you go!](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/09/12/2A5D76C500000578-3154536-A_curious_wild_cat_got_up_close_and_personal_with_a_holidaymaker-a-54_1436440459389.jpg)\n\"Pet me\"\nIf it helps, Cheetahs very rarely attack humans and a lot of places allow tourists to go into Cheetah enclosures because of how rare attacks are!\nI got to take one for a walk on a leash at a cheetah rescue once!

As a girl, it feels kinda good. \nNo, but I can push a tampon out using only my pelvic floor muscles. \nAs a guy, this is fascinating to me. \nI imagine it's like pooping. But from the front. And not poop. But otherwise the same.\nundefined\nundefined\nAs a guy, it also feels kinda good\nSeconded. Feels pretty great.\nundefined\nundefined\nIf you mean the cheetah's tail movements, no. Everything about their anatomy has evolved to allow them to run extremely fast for short distances and do it extremely well. \n\nThe movement of their tail acts as a counter balance for their body's momentum to allow them to make tight, quick turns without losing footing or speed. What wouldn't otherwise be a hard meal to capture has become easier. If you watch the gif, you can tell the tail movements are deliberate in order to make the quick direction changes.

I am a f'ing mess.\nThese experiences will be the platform of your emotional constitution in the future!  You'll be a hardened veteran of humanity.  Your survival is important!\nYES!!!!!!  But now, all the feels.  Later, emotional bad ass.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ZNo9THU.jpg\nOMG, you guys just restored my faith in humanity.  Thank you :)\nundefined\n[Here are ducklings going down a miniature water slide.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpiGS-3PDU8) &lt;3\nundefined\nundefined\nIt's a little early for the turkey dump. Sorry it happened man.\nI'm heartbroken and I did the dumping!  Breakups suck all around.\nundefined\nundefined\nI read all the \"Again, Again!\" In Reinhardts voice\n\"CATCHPHRASE!!!\"\nundefined\nundefined\nI'm afraid that dog will fall through the steps.\nThat's how I felt as a kid when going up or down the staircases in homes that are made to each be separate with a small space between one another. I thought I'd be falling forever into the unknown darkness, so I'd run up and down them to escape, which made it even riskier.\nNothing was worse than going to somebody's house with an unfinished basement and clinging for dear life to the railing so I don't fall through.\nYou won't fall through silly, the clown under the stairs will pull you through. \nಠ_ಠ\nWe all ~~float~~ **fall** down here.\nI keep my clown in my attic thank you.\nundefined\nundefined\nThat's how I still feel lol\nStairs without railings, too! I feel like I'm on the Bridge of Khazad Dûm.\nConsidering I'm terrified of heights, that kind of stairs make me incredibly uncomfortable \nThat's exactly my problem with it. For me, the scariest part of a ride is, if the station is high up, climbing the stairs.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nSo was I!\nHe/she took those stairs like a boss though\ncame here to find this.  it made me cringe the whole loop\nI got 2 stories for this.\n\nWhen I was quite young we had a cat that was not fixed. One of the kittens from her last litter (before her getting fixed), did fall through the steps. And despite what you hear about cats, he did not land on his feet. He landed on his head. Child me watched it all happen and was sure the cat was fucked. Thankfully he turned out to be fine. \n\nThe other story is my nephew puppy. He came over recently and was terrified of the stairs. They didn't even have gaps, they're just steep. So I put him on my lap (mastiff, is big doggo, I'm also your typical weak nerd) and slid down the stairs. After that he would race up and down the stairs over and over again to smell all of the house. Silly doggo. He may have done it repeatedly because I gave him many praises for getting downstairs the first few times. \nObviously it isn't the first time it's happened, but it takes a lot to get a dog used to steps like that. The first place I ever lived was a duplex and we had the top apartment, with a back porch that went to the yard. The stairs had no backing like this because outside it's pretty pointless, and yet it took weeks to get any dog I've ever had accustomed to them, even the ones that couldn't fit through them. By the time they're this comfortable, they're probably more graceful at the stairs than I am.\nundefined\nSo he just gets to go all he wants for free, huh?\nThe owners are yelling to stop but have to keep coughing up.\nHe pays with cuteness.\nundefined\nThe ride is charged per person, dog is not person.\nundefined\nIf you cut this gif a little differently, it would be a near-perfect loop.\n[deleted]\nOh i was super confused. You're on mobile aren't you.\nThey probably are, but you can see how long a gif is and even scroll to different parts of it by right clicking and hitting \"Show controls\"\nI... i both hate, and love you right now. \nundefined\nOnly gifvs though. \nundefined\nundefined\nCan someone make this a perfect loop?\nI hope someone does. I'd like to think that somewhere out there this dog is still riding down that slide over and over with a huge grin on his face.  \nundefined\nI love how he wags his tail as he's going down.\nDogs are just so wonderful when they're enjoying themselves.\n\n\"OH MY GOSH I AM THE HAPPY OH BOY OH BOY I LOVE BEING DOG\"\n&gt; I AM THE HAPPY \nI AM THE ONE WHO WAGS\nundefined\nCalm down Starfire\nundefined\nI have three dogs, one of them is an aussie with no tail. She seems so unhappy all the time since you can't see her wagging... Makes her seem like a moody bitch even though in her head she is probably wagging. \nOne of my brothers dog has a docked tail (needed for health reasons - not just cosmetic) so there's a little stump there.\n\nYou can still see the stump wag and it's freaking adorable.\nundefined\nIt's pretty great.  11/10\nundefined\nSource please.\n[She belongs to the people that own the carnival and is cute AF :)](https://youtu.be/VXq_722H46k)\nThis is the only vertical video I'm okay with.\nI hate vertical videos too, but I'll let it slide this time.\n*begrudging upvote*\nundefined\nundefined\nYou know, I've seen a lot of horrible things on the internet today. I really needed this. Thanks, man. \n/r/eyebleach is a good place as well\nor s/he could try googling their username...\n&gt; s/he\n\nHow to tell someone's an experienced internet user. \nundefined\nundefined\nWell this just made my day 500% better.\nI thought this was a little cruel at first then I saw the dog sprinting for more. I also noticed his tail wagging on the way down\nAfter years of searching, I finally found my spirit animal. \nundefined\nI've been suffering from the strongest depression of my life and trying to find any reason to smile. This did it for me. A reddit post.  Thank you.\nHang in there man. I hope things get better soon! Sending out some good vibes to you\nundefined\nOP, are you Reinhardt?\nI'm a zarya girl myself :). \"Welcome to the gun show\"\nundefined\nLets be honest, Rein would probably be the first one on the slide. Dude enjoys life to the fullest.\nFound the Reinhardt main.\n\n\nundefined\nThis is from a carnival in Beasejour, Manitoba near my town. I saw this video yesterday. RIP potential karma\nHang in there. You'll get your r/aww karma someday, senile_rapist.\nundefined\nPlot twist: the dog is actually incredibly afraid and is running to his master for protection each time. Only to be thrown down again.\nLooks like a Carny Terrier.\nWell that's just the cutest fucking thing I have ever seen.  I feel like if we showed this to cops they'd stop shooting black people.  It's that powerfully adorable.\n&gt; What if you could travel to parallel worlds? The same year, the same Earth, only different dimensions. A world where the Russians rule America... or where your dreams of being dog came true... or where San Francisco was a maximum-security prison. My friends and I found the gateway. Now the problem is... finding a way back home. \nDid you just post the opening to Sliders? Why? What? Why? \nBecause the dog is a slider.\nOh god Dammit, you've been waiting hours for this haven't you? \n:D\nundefined\nHe'll sleep well tonight!\nWhelp, that's the cutest thing I'm going to see today.\nWow, I got kind of nervous while that little guy was running up the stairs.\nI love dogs. \nundefined\nAt first I thought that was a cat, and I was thinking \"Again, Again...is NOT what that cat is thinking\".  lol\nI thought it was an otter....  then I was like \"man, I bet otters would like this as much or more than a dog\"\nundefined\nHe's so fluffy!!\nAnd some say he's still sliding to this day. \nundefined\n",

You illuminate your subject without getting the horrible glass reflections.\n\nEdit, you wouldn't use a polarized filter indoors. It's better outdoors in full sun to make the blues and greens appear more saturated, but works best  when aiming at a 90 angle from the sun/light source.\nYour teaching us how to better annoy zoo animals?\nA polarization filter would block half of all of the light, in addition to blocking light bouncing off of the glass IF it is at the right angle. Better off not using a flag when you shoot through glass.\nPolarisation filter and a lens with a large aperture would work. That way you either eliminate or blur out the reflections from the glass. Although if you have such a lens you probably don't need to use the flash anyway unless it's really, really dark.\nNope, sorry. Pola filters only block light that is polarised perpendicular to the filter orientation. Flash light is not normally polarised significantly, hence most of it will blast straight through the filter.  Even cross-polarised flash light will usually still show a visible reflection.  \nLikewise, a wide aperture (i.e. out of focus reflections) will just give you an out of focus white flash reflection.  \nOff-camera flash or an obtuse angle to the glass are actual techniques to avoid flash reflections. \nWent to the Ripleys aquarium in Toronto. It's very dim inside with well backlit tanks. So much flash photography.\nWHAT\n\nWHITE LIGHT CAN'T PASS THROUGH GLASS?!\nSure it can, but the white light that's reflected from the glass gets back to the lens faster than the white light reflected from the subject behind the glass.\nWhite light, beams melt stfu dobny\nThat's already much further than most people who operate cameras can think ;)\nThat isn't how how glass works. \"Some\" of the light is going to bounce off the glass, the rest will pass through. \nundefined\nNo mother should have to introduce her children to the world in a Zoo tank. \n[Omelette](https://youtu.be/6-FS86NTBSM)\nThat version has no music.\n[Here is the version with music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXFldV3ImU0)\nSong is [Águas De Março](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppF8toTPRx0) for anyone curious.\nIs this video some kind of new, shitty copypasta?\nIt's better with the music. Great little animation. Someone linked it above with the music by Elis Regina.\nYeah it's a great short\n\nThing is I've seen it posted in a few threads already and, like this one, it had absolutely nothing to do with the original comment.\nEven weirder is that it is several years old and now seeing its second life. \nYeah I'm not really sure how it is related, but I personally will never be bothered by seeing it posted, even randomly.\nNow I want a breakfast burrito.\nMeta.\nThe entire point of keeping that poor animal in that cage is to have people pay to take pictures of it.\n\nThere's no other reason.\nIt's a \"what the fuck moment\" for me and I'm not even behind the glass. \n\"Why are we inside this perspex cage mommy?\"\nundefined\nFlash photography against glass really makes the images crystal clear\nSomeone should merge the anti-paparazzi scarf with the glass partitions on these zoo enclosures, so that when someone takes a flash photo all they see is solid white on the glass. Perhaps the resulting photo could also say something like \"FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY HARMS THE ANIMALS. YOU ARE A JERK.\"\n\nhttp://petapixel.com/2016/07/01/anti-paparazzi-scarf-makes-flash-photography-impossible/\nThey're pretty much already going to see just solid white on it.\nThis right here, if I ever see flash against glass I assume the person is a dumbass and shouldn't use the $1500 DSLR daddy got them.\nI love when I see flashes in the crowds at sporting events and concerts too. It instantly makes me feel less stupid than about 10000 people.\nWhy do you care so much if an amateur uses an expensive camera incorrectly? Everyone has to start somewhere.\nEveryone can read a manual and not look like an idiot too, but hey to each their own. \nIf I see flash ever, I assume you're either a journalist with a expensive as fuck flash or ~~a retard~~ never took time to learn about photography. \nOr you are taking a photo as proof as something happened, and not as a quality piece of art to admire. Flash helps a lot outside of sun / at night. \u0001F319\u0001F60E \nObviously flash is important, but not against glass. With practice you can adjust the power so it's the perfect fill rather than complete wash out.\nAre you saying you don't need to use flash, ever?\nAlmost always the answer is no you should not use flash, especially if you want the background as well as your foreground. \nSometimes you need to freeze the action in a dark shot, and if you know what you are doing, you can also get a good exposure on a static background. \nWell, you [*can* use flash creatively to light a scene](http://strobist.blogspot.de/2006/03/on-assignment.html), but that usually requires off-camera flash and that you know what you're doing. You'd also tend to work *with* the existing light in those cases, not against it. If you don't know what you're doing you're usually better off using no flash at all (especially the built-in tiny one).\nThat website looks sketchy as hell.\nUsing flash as a fill light against a strongly lit background or bounced of the ceiling in a dimly lit room are pretty good reasons to use one. \nI use regular ol' fill flash quite a bit in bright sunlight.  Really helps with harsh shadows and you keep from blowing out the background.  \n[deleted]\nWell not just your aperture. You can also adjust your shutter speed and ISO. Changing your aperture will fuck with your depth of field.\nNot really true, at all. You can use flash 100% of the time of you bounce it right.\nNot to mention the new born probably has no idea what it is and could've been stressed about it\ncan they see at that age.  I thought most cats were super vulnerable early on. \nMost animals are born with basic sight - this cub is not completely newborn and definitely would be able to see, though would be very short-sighted.  Flashes could definitely be startling.\nMy assumption would be they may not see clearly, but constant flashes could be stressful\nThat was at the San Diego zoo.  It is the zoo Joan Embery represented for so long on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and Jay Leno. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Embery\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3020268/Baby-s-ROAR-Adorable-4lb-jaguar-cub-shows-fangs-makes-debut-San-Diego-Zoo.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo\n\nEdit: Blep http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/episode-3317-pictured-joan-embery-from-the-zoological-society-of-san-picture-id140899369?s=594x594\nNo flash photography please\n[deleted]\nLacks context. A maternity ward is a mom+baby cage, but it's a better alternative to popping one out in the woods.\nAnd how is it a better alternative ? Not disagreeing, just new on the topic..\nImagine yourself going into labor and being given the choice between a hospital or on the stump of bug infested tree. \nthatsmyfetish.org\nundefined\nundefined\nZoos preserve endangered species by protecting them from poachers, illness, and other threats. For some species, the zoos and wildlife refuges are their only hope for survival.\nIt's really sad that this is the case and \"how about we don't keep them in cages?\" doesn't work, but I am super glad we have places working on the preservation of species. We can't turn back the clock and we can't always prevent the onslaught of man, so preservation like this is the best we can do. \nZoos raise awareness and the animals are happy.\nAnimals are happy in many of zoos...but my god are there some serious outliers in that one.\nNo argument there.\nHow the fuck do you know they're happy? Do you talk to them? \nNope. I just work there. If you don't know what an animal looks like when it's happy, you're not in any position to be talking about it. You're dismissed :)\nSo working at a zoo makes you an expert in animal psychology now? If that's the case that makes every prison gaurd an expert in human psychology. How can anyone say an animal is better off locked up in a cage? Whatever helps you sleep at night right? You're dismissed ;) \nLet me clear some shit up about zoos.  \n\n1. Most animals in zoos are endangered. Contrary to popular belief, they are *not* endangered because of zoos. In fact, one of the few reasons that most animals like this leopard are even around in the numbers that they are is because of rehabilitation *because of zoos*. Success stories like this one aren't because the leopards \"survived despite the zoo's best efforts to eradicate them.\" That is cock and bull nonsense. The rehabilitation that zoos carry out is imperative to the preservation of *many* of the world's creatures. This brings me to my next point:  \n\n2. After zoos receive an animal, it is first evaluated for release. In other words, the zoo determines whether the animal is fit to be released into the wild. There are many different types of animals that show up at zoos. I'll talk about the three most common.  \nFirst, there are the animals that were caught wounded or sick or displaced in the wild. Wounded by poachers, displaced by habit destruction and/or climate change. These animals are the least likely to live out their lives in an institution and most likely to be released back, depending on how they heal up if necessary.  \nSecond, we have the animals who were rescued from less responsible and more sinister, charlatan \"zoos.\" These institutions are the ones at whom you should be aiming your anger. It is these institutions that give all zoos a bad name. These rescued animals are the ones where it can be a toss up if they are released. If they are basically fine, but just need a little TLC, they are gradually moved form a solitary or medical enclosure to the enclosure closest to the environment they would face in the wild so that they may a. get used to others of their own kind if they were kept in those deplorable surroundings we've all heard about or b. get used to living on their own if that is what they naturally do. These are the programs that are mostly responsible for populations of animals increasing in various natural parks and sanctuaries. These programs are the ones most responsible for the elephant populations rising in Africa and the Panda populations improving in China.  \nAnd finally, we have the animals that are so affected by what they have gone through, the best thing we can do for them is to give them a safe and nurturing place for them to live out the rest of their lives. The animals are very well taken care of and loved. They are like family. These abused and injured animals are *not* unhappy. If you did an ounce of actual research you would know that.  \n\n3. Lastly, the animals in the zoos *are not* being exploited. The zoos use the money to pay staff, for new enclosure, research for new programs, better equipment, higher quality care for the animals. Zoos need the money so that they can keep doing what they do best: rehabilitate animals and spread awareness on a massive scale so people like you aren't so woefully misinformed about the world.  \n\nI volunteer part time at San Diego Safari Park. This is what we do. This what I'm studying to become. Don't give zoos a bad name because without them, we wouldn't have come so far in trying to fix a problem that is damn near unfixable.  \n\nSource: I work in this and see a lot of this firsthand. \nNope. I know our policies for taking care of these creatures. We have policies for a reason.. I also know that our world revolves around these creatures, morning noon and nice. We treat like they are family and take of like the are our own. Considering your knowledge of how the world works is negligible, believe I will sleep very very soundly at night.. Good day :)\nHow do you know when your pets are happy?\nHe probably doesn't have pets or else misinterprets everything they do as them wanting more food. Basic humans lmao \nundefined\nYeah, better allow them to become an ingredient of Chinese viagra.\nWe get it... just go to bed.  GOODNIGHTELIZABETH\nundefined\nI've never said it before, but you are receiving the exact right amount of downvotes for this comment.\nIt tears my heart every time I see someone go to the zoo \nundefined\n\"Ok, first you put your paw up to the glass. The humans *love* that. Good. Now yell as loud as you can!\"\n\"MOOOOMMM!\"\n\n^^\"WWWHHHYYYY!?\"\n&gt;look what I made\n[You made this?](http://i.imgur.com/snLplqq.jpg) \n\nEdit: I don't get the downvotes :( It's totally relevant\nReddit is a harsh and fickle mistress.\nNo idea, it's always funny and relevant. *man hug*\nThose little murder mittens.\n\nCutest little killing machine \n*tiny roar*\n^^*roooooaaaaar*\nCome now my child, and meet your captors. Learn to hate them, as did I and my mother before you.\n\nOne day, my mother said to me, I could be the hero that would disperse this invisible shield the meat masters use to hold us and protect their tasty bodies from our wrath. To liberate our people...\n\nBut I am old and tired, and the magic wall has bested me. But you, my child, could be that hero talked of for generations. Believe, child, in yourself as I believe in you.\n:(\n[deleted]\nundefined\n\"i made this\"\n&gt;This is the biggest poop I ever made\ndude, I think you posted in the wrong sub. this is a gif of adorable, big ole kitty love!

I want to woosh and kiss and cuddle all over those things. too bad they can't be domesticated as pets.\n.... Woosh?\nyup, a big ole squishy wooshy hug. \nI just want to follow you around all day and watch you sow dissent.\nIt ain't always so innocuous and light-hearted. Mortality defines us. Finite existence and physical emotion makes monsters out of minds. Fear is the number one motivator for humanity. Most of our negativity stems directly from that bullshit. My journey is a bleak one, friend. You're welcome to tag along, but know that it would be a waste of life. A waste of consciousness. \n\nPour up!!!!!\nWhen I realized he's trolling, his comments suddenly went from wtf to hilarious.\n ... Ferd? Is that you?\nundefined\nIs this some Ken M shit?\nundefined\nShit... Kind of sad...that moment the baby realizes she can't walk past the glass...\nWas the flash photography necessary?\nStop with the flash RAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWR \nIf you see the full video you'll see how stressed the mother is, and the flashes don't help\nOkay, here's my replacement...can I go home now?\nMommy was probably born in captivity-big cats breed quite easily in zoos.\nThis might be one of the few instances I've encountered where the momma animal is more beautiful than the cub \nI HATE this video, flash photography is really pushing it when humans interact with newborn animals! No me gusta...\nFlash photography?  Around a baby? What are you, some kind of idiot?\nDoes being raised in captivity not just sound sick as fuck? For some reason when that baby touched the glass like \"this is my world.\" just bothered the fuck out of me, knowing it won't live in its natural habitat..\nIt's a rough life not having to worry about getting eaten every day, or where the next meal comes from, or if the weather is going to kill you that evening.\n\nThe vast majority of modern day zoos go out of their way to ensure the well being of their animals both physically and mentally.  And the staff directly responsible for their animals have a true love for them and what they do.\nSure it's an easy lifestyle, although is holding another in captivity for the sake of viewing pleasure really worth it? With the exception of the Memphis Zoo, every zoo I've been to in US seems extremely underfunded and the animals suffer from lack of attention &amp; captivity. Not to mention the tragic.. \"Sea World\"\n\nI guess capitalism will always win if there's a demand for it. Seeing exotic animals in capitivity like sloths and jaguars is weird to me.. There's just a degree of separation between captive and the real life of animals I don't think should be dictated by a larger spieces. Its like forcing someone to take the blue pill. As time progresses there will be no natural habitation for the lesser species. Our species will be fake as we are so infatuated with control.\nA lot of these animals in captivity are there for a reason.  Take the small zoo at Busch Gardens for example.  They have 3 bald eagles that are in a cage unable to roam the skies.\n\nYeah you could say we're keeping them locked up and they can never experience the joy of flight again.  But you leave out the fact that all 3 have debilitating injuries that either leaves them flightless or unable to fend for themselves.  It's a symbiotic relation now.  Kids and adults alike get to see these animals and learn about them and their natural habitat, and they get to live without fear of death every single day.\nOh for sure, injured animals need proper care as well. I've been to Bush gardens and seen their pen.. It's riddled with pine trees and tiny. At least when I was there.. It's nice to see them it also kind of sad. There's no end to the debate on captive animals for the general populous.. As I said, if the demand is there, it will be met.\nSame. Fucking hate zoos... yeah, yeah, conservationism and all that... but it still leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth.\nAt least in my experience, zoo animals are pretty well treated. They have a balanced diet, toys/environments that allow them to be stimulated, and they have the ability to socialize with others of their kind.  All without fear of predators.\n\nIt's also great for people.  They can see and learn about animals that they'd only ever read about in books if not for zoos.\n\nI'm not saying all zoos are amazing havens for wildlife, but I think most of them in well developed countries are.\nYup. Its not Victorian England or China anymore.\nMommy's eyes say it all \"I'm allowing this because I know I can't get through this glass and shred you...I've tried.\"\nNants ingonyama bagithi Baba..\n\nSithi uhm ingonyama...\n\n(A king is born!)\nNYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH\n*Tiny roar* \nAre those soundproof one way glass? Its really weird to see cats putting their litter in a (possible) harms way.\n\"These are your owners my child. Hope you like bright lights and glass!\"\nIt's sad to think her baby will only ever know what living in a glass case looks like\n\"And this is the room where the crazy alien monsters that keep us prisoner stair at us through a forcefield.\"\nWhy do they allow flash photography D: \nThey are very cute, but this still makes me sad. That baby will never know anything other than those glass walls. :( \nit'll have a much higher chance of survival tho\nWhat living longer when you don't really get to live and spend your entire life knowing only a glass box? \ntheyre animals, they dont know any difference\nno she isn't\nThese are the people that enslave us\nOn one hand I like seeing exotic animals in person. On the other hand last time I went to the zoo I could tell 50% of the animals there felt trapped.\nAnimals in captivity make me sad.\n\nFuck it. Cute as shit, though.\nWelcome to your prison, son.\nundefined\nThis is very sad\nPoor thing.. Born in a cage.\nRAAAAAAAAWWWWWWRRRRR\nI MAED DIS  \nBeautiful jaguars..\n\nIt's not the same leopard.

And in a good zoo like San Diego, most species live pretty long, happy lives.\nI've never been to that zoo. Do they have an outside area for the jaguar to roam around in? \nundefined\nConservation efforts require a few captive members of the species. If we want to keep the animal around, it has to be kept in captivity at least enough to have a genetically stable population since predator populations are dwindling due to poaching, encroachment, etc.\nCompletely agree. Did u see the disappointment in its eyes when it put its paw to the glass? So sad. \nundefined\nIt just made me so sad that the first thing that pup learns is the limitations of its enclosure.\nhappy that we can see these beautiful animals up close without being killed, sad that they live their whole lives in a little box\nso happy to see them in that beautiful cage.\nThe baby let's out a horrified scream as she touches the glass, realizing she'll be trapped in there for her entire life.

When he does, i feel like i'm slowly suffocating, but i stay like that because cuddling my dog is the best thing ever.\nsuffocating is the best thing ever - Cheryl Tunt\nSploosh.\nWhats the male equivalent of sploosh..\nI guess it's also sploosh, but with semen. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nMy great dane thinks she can fit between me and the couch when I'm laying down, \"yeah, I'm just gonna sneak myself into this little spot here.\"\n[Relevant comic](http://imgur.com/ez9Y3Gt)\nExactly! She's always spilling my wine too, or maybe that's me, but that's beside the point.\nHa! Had a bullmastiff who would insistently try to sit on my lap while driving. Funny thing though, it wasn't too cramped in a 70s Camaro. Love those huge old American made cars.\nYou really shouldn't let your dog drive, it's not safe.\nundefined\ninb4 people competing with their ~~dic~~ dog size.\nIrish wolf hound/Great dane mix has to lay on my chest and try to suffocate me when my alarm goes off.\nundefined\nI bet that is mega warm. \nundefined\nThe problem with large dogs is all think they're small, lap dogs.  I have no idea why they all seem to have no concept of their size.\nI believe it's because people usually have these large breeds sit on their laps and what not as puppies.  They grow up doing it, and see no reason to stop.\nYep. We've bred and actively condition them to retain puppy traits because it's more desirable for a house dog to act that way. It's worse if you have a smaller dog or any cuddly cats in the house, because they also get active examples of behavior we find positive.\n\nWhich is probably why my 70 lb shepherd mix thinks he can walk over me in the middle of the night like my 8 lb cat does. \nI have a 13 pound cat and *he* hurts. This reminds me of when I was younger and I was on the phone with my long distance boyfriend. It was getting frisky, and I was laying lengthwise on the couch, all nestled in...\n\nWhen my 75 pound dog jumps over the back of the couch and onto my stomach.\nI see your 13 pounder and raise you my 26 pound meow meow !\nYou may have accidentally adopted a bobcat. \nI'm almost certain that's what happened \nPictures? For science? Actually for science. \nundefined\nWho said it was an accident?\nLet me guess, Maine Coon? Ours is only 20lbs but he's not purebred.\nundefined\nundefined\nTo be fair I love it.\nWell I don't see a reason they should stop either\nundefined\nMy theory is that they think their head is their whole body. When my German shepherd tries to hide she just hides her head leaving the rest of her body exposed, like if hiding the head means she's already invisible. \nWell that's because if she can't see you, you can't see her. Simple math!\nAlso: toddler math.\nWell we do look really big to them. \nundefined\nThis is such a silly way of thinking about an animals behaviour. Many many large dogs understand how large they are..  And furthermore, they don't 'think they are lap dogs, they just don't care that they are large.\nExactly. If you let your 80lb dog on the couch, it will go on the couch. If you let your 80lb dog climb on you, it will climb on you. When a dog has not consequences for those decisions, it has no reason to stop. Children learn as they grow up that they can't crawl all over adults anymore. If you don't teach a dog it can't crawl all over you... Guess what, they're a dog so they don't figure it out on their own. \nundefined\nSame with my 8,000lb yorkie\nundefined\nI have smaller dogs, but 3 of them. With only 2 hands... you can see my general predicament. \nScientists need to develop a third arm for maximum petting efficiency.\n\"Perhaps mankind was not meant to pet this much.\"\nundefined\n*the future is now, thanks to science!*\nThank you, Clemont.\nundefined\nFoot scratches on the side for my dog when he lays at me feet. Problem solved.\n\nEdit: decided not to edit because pirate.\nundefined\nExact same problem. I had just two for the longest time also, so they're good at sharing. But then the third one came along as a pup and became a huge attention whore. Now its a constant battle.\nAll three of mine are attention whores and the most jealous beings to walk the earth. \n\nBut omg are they so cute in the 4 minutes a day when they aren't being bad. \nundefined\nThe jump between 2 and 3 dogs is so much harder than the jump between 1 and 2.\n\nSource: Have 3 dogs. It's pretty hard for the husband and I to goalie 1.5 dogs during outings.\nundefined\nYou have 2 legs...\n...you know what that means. \n\nI still have room for one more dog. \nundefined\nmy golden weighs about 120lbs and he does this the same\nWhoa your golden weighs 120?

But an almost 200 pound English mastiff on my pretty small lap. \nDamn goldens. It's 4 am here and I just woke up from exactly that. Now the entire bed is his as I sit on the desk typing. Think it's revenge for sending him to dog camp over the weekends.\nYup, 110lb lab/pit. Thinks he's a yorkie\nStory time in my household a 4YO, 2YO, and 90 lb. chocolate lab all trying to sit in my lap at the same time. \n*me\nPics or it didn.....oh ok carry on\nJust give in to the cuddles!!

Thinks hes the size of my sisters doxin. \nundefined\nI love happy endings\nNot from dogs, I hope.\nS-Stop judging me ok\nM-me too thanks. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nmy theory: she is tindering on her phone and the dog senses she is looking for love. So the dog comes over to deliver. \nShe's upset, dog senses it and tries to comfort her\nThis is actually very possible. It's almost eerie how easily dogs pick up on our moods. With my crazy wild coonhound/shepherd mix he usually doesn't chill out for a damn thing, but about a month ago I was pretty upset about something and his mood completely flipped to mellow and consoling. He just knew.\nIn college I went home to my parents house and they had a new dog.  He was young and energetic.  I ended up being sick and laying on the couch all dog*.  Little guy never left my side.  Knew me for a day and knew laying with me would cheer me up.\n\nEdit: day*\n&gt; all dog\n\nYes, yes.\nWe are ALL dog this blessed day :)\nSpeak for yourself \ni am ALL dog on this blessed day :)\nundefined\nThat's how we ended up with our first dog as a couple. My mom's dog had puppies, so we drove up there around Thanksgiving to truck two of them back to our state for people that wanted them. While we were there, my husband got massively sick and spent the entire 3 days laid up on the couch feeling miserable. One puppy in particular wouldn't leave his side, which I thought was adorable. He hadn't been picked yet, and after a couple days I just knew we had to bring him home. The picture of him snuggled up to my husband is one of my favorites. \n\nSo that's how we ended up carting three 10 week old puppies 800 miles.\n\nEdit: [Puppy picture](http://i.imgur.com/REe521y.jpg).\nWhen I was discharged from the ER and still going through some severe intestinal pain, I stayed at my aunt's house to heal up. Every day, I'd wake up to their Golden (who didn't even know me very well) sleeping on the floor near my bed. Such a kindhearted supportive doggo.\nundefined\nundefined\nMy cat (RIP) was like this. He was always aggressive and didn't like to be bothered (well, I was the one he gave some leeway to every now and then), but one day I was on my bed in fetal position, crying because of financial struggles. He sensed how down I felt, first laid on my floor staring at me, then jumped up and curled right under my chin. He *never* did anything like it. I miss him so much. \n\nEDIT: Fetal petal\n&gt; fetal petal\n\n\nundefined\nundefined\nOh oh! I have a story for this. My friend's kid was crying because he was being a little shit, and my cat (who hated him and enjoyed chasing him) came over and curled up and snuggled with him until he stopped crying. And then promptly left.\n\nI have a picture.\nDeliver pls\nThey're not super great pics, but here:\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/H0JDmP3\n\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/prGpJfv\nThen I have a dog instead of a cat. Every time I'm upset she comes over and lays on me and purrs. If I'm in my chair she just meows until I pick her up and pet her and purrs. I have had a Pom do something similar to what the fog is doing, I miss her, she was so much smaller.\nWhenever I'm sick, my dogs refuse to leave my side.\n\nDogs know...\nundefined\nOr she has brain cancer but doesn't know it yet, [but the dog does...](http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/can-dogs-detect-human-health-problems/) and is trying to make her last days the best it can...\nFuck\nThis is the inverse of the typical Reddit \"Cute thing animal does means it's going to die soon\" comment.\nundefined\nShe's recording herself, doubt it\nMy theory: she's recording herself, it's all horseshit and life is pain\nundefined\nundefined\nI couldn't sleep last night so I got out of bed and went to the living room to watch TV.  Within 2 minutes my dog started crying, because I left.  My wife let him out of the bedroom and he came running to the couch, jumped up and collapsed at my side, laying his head on my stomach.  \n\nI don't think anyone will ever love me as much as my lil dude.  \nundefined\nMy human engages cuddling posture?  \n....  \nYou accidentally moved, let me correct that for you ... again.  \n...  \nMaybe it's not cuddling time? ...\nNah, can't be, i know my human.  \n...   \nSee, i was right. What would my human only do without me?\nI laughed so hard at this because this is exactly what my dog does to me, and what I believe is going through her head too! XD\nundefined\ni just witness a dog train a human\nundefined\nWas getting a little worried that the little pupper wasn't gonna get the love/attention it deserves\ni was getting ready to clench my fist into a meme at that girl, then she won me over and i love her now\nWhat does, \"clench my fist into a meme\", mean?\n\n\n\nNo one knows what it means, but it's provocative. It gets the people going.\nBALL SO HARD\nDat shit cray\nAINT IT JAY? WHAT SHE ORDER? FISH FILAAAAYYYY\nundefined\nAnd another cray.\nundefined\nundefined\nA [clenched fist that raises the spirits of the people?](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/redfaction/images/2/2a/RF_Logo.png/revision/latest?cb=20110819204124)\nFull communism now?\nundefined\n&gt;No one knows what it memes\n\nFTFY\nundefined\n[Know Your Meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/arthur-s-fist)\nIs it just me or are memes getting more and more minimalistic as time goes on \nmememalistic\nWe should just shorten mememalistic to meme. \nIs it just me or are memes getting more and more meme as time goes on\nIs it just meme or are memes getting meme and meme meme as time memes on\nMeme meme meme meme meme meme memes meme meme meme meme meme meme meme memes meme \nundefined\nso mememeta meme\nCalling things a meme is now a thing. Which means calling memes a meme is now a meme.\nTwitter memes don't get as long to develop as 4chan memes do before they hit the spotlight.\nundefined\nundefined\n&gt; clench my fist into a meme\n\n\nI've never wanted people to take a random phrase and make it happen before.\nundefined\nFor a second I thought she was literally Hitler\nEh, Hitler was actually quite nice to his dogs (apart from that one time he had them shot or poisoned with cyanide).\nOK, worse than Hitler then\nNever go full Hitler. 10-60% every once in a while....ok. I mean, we all need that. But never 100%. \nundefined\nSame, I thought the title was from the pup's perspective toward the end there\nBut honestly a pet that does this isn't doing it because of lack of attention, it could be argued that it has too much...\nYup, this girl abused this animal into being so emotionally needy that the dog is obviously unhappy and unwell. One could equate this with extreme neglect / animal abuse / Michael Vick. \n\n^^^^^/s\ncould you make that /s any smaller\nundefined\nundefined\nWith two Poms you can practice cheerleading.\nYou can also practice the art of cleaning up dog hair.\nundefined\nundefined\nmy dog does this all the time, know no boundaries\nThey both won in the end.\nundefined\nCute, but who films these things?\nExtreme selfie chick\nsomeone who wants to capture the silly behavior of their pet. I know a girl whose cat jumps on her shoulders every time she sits down to play the piano, so she filmed herself playing around specifically to capture the cat jumping on her.\nundefined\nWe don't deserve dogs. \u0001F622\nI mean, we treat them very well in comparison to almost anything else. Sure, mean people that abuse dogs exist, but I'd argue that we have significantly more that give unconditional love to their dogs (I'd say a vast majority of dog owners, or people in general, fall into this category).\n\nUnconditional love is what drives people to say we don't deserve dogs, but we reciprocate it too. \n\nI think dogs and humans make great partners, and that we deserve each other.\nThank you for not being a fucking downer like other folks are. Dogs are great, lets treat them great.\n&gt; GOD, YOU'RE ALL FUCKING DOWNERS.  YOU FUCKING DESERVE DOGS, YOU FUCKING IDIOTS, BECAUSE THEY'RE FUCKING GREAT AND SO ARE YOU.  FUCK YOU.\nWHY DO WE HAVE TO YELL????\nBECAUSE IT'S PROVOCATIVE AND IT GETS PEOPLE GOING\nMETA\nundefined\nundefined\nHumans and dogs have been evolving together in symbiotic relationship for a very very long time. It makes sense.\nIn terms of the animal kingdom, they literally are man's best friend\nundefined\nundefined\nYou can only give so much undivided attention until you just need a moment to yourself. Right now I'm petting my dog with my foot. I think it's a nice compromise. \nMy dog was just creeping around the couch trying to decide if he should jump up here. He's done it about 20 times and I'm not calling him over because I think it's funny. \nI had to put my Pomeranian down a couple of years ago. She looked and acted just like the one in the OP. Any time I found myself neglecting her I immediately gave her attention because I knew she wasn't going to be around forever. I was working across the country when she got sick and when it was time to put her to sleep I flew across the country last minute so I could be by her side when the time came.  People think I'm crazy for the amount of money I spent trying to make her better but in the end I guess it was just her time to go. It was awful, and still is, but I would go through it all again because she was worth it. One thing that brought me comfort is she never had to go through the pain of losing us like the pain we felt losing her.\nundefined\nWhy not? We give them free food and lodging and deliver them from all hardship and stress they would experience in the wild. They get a pretty damn good deal. \nundefined\n\"What did I do to deserve you?\" - dogs\nundefined\nI'm at college right now away from home. Holy shit I miss my dog :(\nVisit your dog every chance you get. In my last college years, I was so busy and stuff I almost didn't pay attention to our family's miniature schnauzer, Toby. Then I moved away from my parent's 5 years ago, I didn't go visit except for once every few months and then had to listen from afar how he was slowly withering away from old age and last year when I saw him and he almost couldn't walk anymore on his last days it killed me like no other thing. I really could have seen him more as I'm only 1 hour away form my parent's. Only good thing is when he passed, I was away from it all and didn't have to go through that.\nIt is jealous of the phone - you can see in its last effort the dog doesn't care until the second she looks at her phone. Smart pup!\nThe way the dog first nestles into the girl's arms is r/mildlysatisfying\nundefined\nAs someone with allergies I'm extremely jealous of her ability to continue breathing in this situation. I always feel like cute little furry things are trying to kill me!\nMaybe they are and the allergy is unrelated. Especially if the furry things are mostly cats.\nundefined\nDogs: keeping young people social, its not an easy job but someones got to do it.\nundefined\nCompletely staged. That dog clearly knows the camera is there.\nundefined\nThat's a funny looking cat. \n[RELEVANT](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=anbrC3x5r6Y)\nundefined\nWhat kind of breed is that dog? it's adorable\nLooks like a Pomeranian.\nThank you!\nundefined\nundefined\n[This is my cat every time I get on the bed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAXenxPyCtk)\nMy gf does this. \nMay be cultural differences, but in the U.S. having a dog for a girlfriend is frowned upon.\nundefined\nundefined\nLooks like it's been hanging around too much with the cat\nThat's a weird looking cat. \nMy cat does this. while im on my laptop she tries to lie in the space between my laptop and chest :/\nBetter quality, original post, and uncropped version here: http://imgur.com/gallery/F31uf?lr=0 \nShe obviously staged this. That dog is actually an actor whom she hired on Craigslist.\n\nr/karmaconspiracy\nMy pom is just like this, and she just has to be in your face too. Adorable as hell, but doesn't understand when it's not lap-time.\n\"WHY WONT YOU LOVE ME???\" - dog \n\"He doesn't love you like i do!\"\nI have a cat that does this when I try to study, so I just nap with him instead lol.\nWhat an odd looking cat....\nmy dog is currently sitting on my chest\nWhy is no one wondering why there's a hidden camera in her room. Op explain.\n\"Hidden\"\nundefined\nLet that little round fox be comfortable!!\nundefined\nIs it common for people to just have webcams recording themselves in the bedroom?\nShe looks at it quickly at least twice that I can tell so far during this video. 75% sure this is a karma grab.\nI figured it was set up to demonstrate a common occurrence. Unless she specifically trained the dog to behave this way.\nundefined\nMy cat does this, but I'm not pretty enough to be in an internet gif. \n\nTotally worth the face/nose/mouthful of fur to be reminded that life is not on our phones.\nI was thinking OP was pulling a fast one from r/perfectloops\nJust as you think all hope is lost...\nMy 70 lb gsd does this too,you sitting anywhere  with your legs crossed or elbows on your legs,then hes there to fill the hole he sees haha\nMy 23 lb Maine Coon does this too.\nMy cat does the same and will not stop until he gets affection. Animals train us. :)\nMy dog does this except he is a 90 lb German Shepherd, and he isnt done growing.\nSo is this staged or do some people just record their bed 24/7?\nThis is really cute.

It's heartbreaking having to put down an otherwise healthy dog because they can no longer walk. \n\nIt's all I think about now when I see things like this. \nHorrible. My boy (we had him for almost 12 years, gsd) was just put down five days ago because he developed a neurodegenerative disorder and couldn't move his back legs. It's hard to even fathom that he's gone. Sorry for your loss. They're the absolute best. \nundefined\nAn adorable genetical abomination that should never exist to begin with. These poor dogs are born to suffer from so much pain and sickness during their lifetime just to please people with their \"adorable\" features.\nYeah, certain breeds of dogs should be phased out. Bulldogs cannot give birth naturally, due to the selective breeding we've put them through. A lot of this is the fault of organizations like the AKC, and another fault is the designer dog trend. Dogs that are bred for certain standards should be assessed for those standards based on ability to perform tasks and, overall, lifetime health. \n\nBreed standard should never be based on things like cuteness, coat color, or facial structure. Docking of tails should be illegal unless it prevents later-life medical issues. In fact I think breed standards should be done away with on a competition level, and replaced with group standards. Whether the dog looks more like an Aussie or an English Sheepdog, what should matter is how well they perform their job, and how healthy they are. \nThis is why people should completely get behind the English Old tyme bulldog. They are actively trying to breed the 'bad' traits from bulldogs.\n\nWe have one and she can run for ages doesn't snort and has no health problems (apart from swallowing a ball but hey she's greedy!!)\n\nEdit - as people have asked for pictures;\n\nOh my goodness - where do I start.\n\nWell this is one of my favourites from when she was tiny;\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/98c10\n\nHere's a much more recent one;\nhttp://imgur.com/a/1BIW0\nThere's also the [Swiss Bulldog](https://m.imgur.com/ZGPuEe1)\nWhat a beautiful looking dog - I had no idea they existed.\nMy buddy has one of these!

We do.\nSee response above!\nundefined\nI don't think they should be phased out, but they need to have other breeds brought in to increase diversity and less extremity.  A new test came out that found that the genetic diversity in English Bulldogs is so low they are going to die off anyway unless that is done.   \n  \nThere's no dog with less diversity than the English Bulldog.  A podcast here discusses it.  I've only read about it second hand, I'm deaf so I can't listen to it.  Oh, they have a transcript!  I'm about to read it.  They have people arguing both sides, and one is a breeder of French Bulldogs (he's the wrong one).\n http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/is-a-healthier-english-bulldog-possible/  \n \nThis is the study\nhttp://cgejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40575-016-0036-y \n \nTwo well written blog posts about this study, the person is in the UK so references to the kennel club are the one there, not the AKC but it doesn't matter because the bulldog information is spot on and was researched in the US to boot.\n \nhttp://pedigreedogsexposed.blogspot.com/2016/07/death-of-bulldog.html\n \nAnd UC (the school that did the study) threw down the gauntlet and said they'd test any purebred English Bulldog to find one that has diversity, if the dog meets the \"healthy\" criteria first.\n \nhttp://pedigreedogsexposed.blogspot.com/2016/09/uc-davis-challenge-prove-youve-got.html\n \nI used the blog posts because they explained a lot more than I can put in a simple response here.\n \n\n \n\nundefined\nI always wish there was a second gif with ones like this showing the same breed of dog with horrible skin infections and crippling arthritis to balance out all the idiots that see these gifs and decide they want one.\nundefined\nundefined\nMy face is melting \nI died of how cute this was.\nundefined\n[deleted]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kn9mCeCZzQ&amp;ab_channel=ProfessorElemental-Topic\nundefined\nundefined\nThis dog is for me, yes? \nundefined\nundefined\nYou should dress her up as a loaf of bread.\nShe already is \n\nhttp://hejibits.com/comics/2011-08-08-breadwinner.png\nI've never had so many mixed feelings from a comic before.\nMixed?

I think it's because he wants to put in the least amount of effort possible before someone will help him up. \nI don't think she swears.\nundefined\nWhy is that door step so high?\nProbably lives on an area prone to flooding\nhttp://imgur.com/a/HX5mC\n\nGalveston is one of those places.  They get hurricane seasons and several of them can hit over a summer.  Also doesn't help that it's an island in the gulf.\n\nI remember when I visited the Historic Downtown site, all of the shops were raised up on either a platform or stairs.  Even the streets had stairs going up to the sidewalks.\n\nSo many stairs.  Gets tiresome really quickly.  Not my ideal vacation spot but it is pretty.\n\n\nThat looks like wheelchair-hell\nSo anyone in Galveston never really misses leg day.\nToo much HDR on Galveston Island.\nYep. A ton of Hawaii is like that for Tsunamis and stuff. It's odd to see at first then it just makes sense. \n\nundefined\nundefined\nIt's a submarine \nReal reason?\n\nThat door would have originally been timber, with a small step (to account for the floor level inside). There wouldn't have been a bottom section to the door frame. The wooden door would have been flush with the floor, possibly with a draught-excluding brush attached to the inside.\n\nThe UK has, for the most part, moved over to plastic doors and windows, because they're cheap and easy to install by unskilled workmen. \n\nTimber doors and windows are a bit of a 'middle class' luxury for most people.\n\nThey come as a complete unit, with a bottom part to the frame. It's easier to make them slightly too small and then bulk out the existing frame with mortar. \n\nTl;dr - it wasn't originally built quite that high - new door designs means about 2\"/50mm has been added by the bottom part of the door frame.\n\n\nundefined\nWas wondering the same thing... then thought about how if that were my house I'd be faceplanting daily because I'm a klutz.\nUsually it helps delay rising water from entering or preventing it entirely. \nundefined\nundefined\nLooks like a house in England. That's just the way it is for certain houses.\nSettle down Mr Jackson.\nbut usually the foundation would just be higher rather than the door frame just being higher and the floors inside being ground level. that makes no sense to me. But I guess it works lol \nundefined\nYou don't understand.  Chunks is my dog.  \nMy mom is bad at jokes. I told her that joke and about six months later she calls, \"Listen to my joke.

But nonetheless this dog has a big heart and ready to conquer any obstacle in their path!\nNothing can help English Bulldogs age. The breed is 100% fucked up. The only way to save the breed is to revise the breed standard and cross breed other dogs into the bloodlines. There isn't enough genetic diversity to save them. I wish people would stop buying English Bulldogs. It's damn near inhumane to breed a dog that can't even give birth naturally and has such a litany of health problems bred into them.\nYeah, when I see videos like this, at first it's kind of funny. But then I realize I'm laughing at a once noble and athletic animal that we bred into some sort of freak for our own amusement.\nundefined\nundefined\nHe's not gonna stay that size for long..\nundefined\nundefined\nHe is all bulldog! :) Reminds me of my dear little bulldog who recently passed away at age 9 years.\nMine just passed yesterday. Such goofy dogs real fun to just watch them be dogs.\nSorry to hear :( \nThank you, I just hope he was happy while I had him. I'm making sure to give my other dogs extra love now while I still have them.\nundefined\nundefined\nHow adorable. We have a bulldog too and his name is Chunk too!! \nThey grow so fast! \nThis is my big boy: http://imgur.com/gallery/dsG9P\nundefined\nLil brudder- the heart of a champion!\nOh, L'il Brudder!\n\nI don't know what I'm doing with my life!\n\nI'm thinking of getting into male modeling...\n\nOr maybe...\n\n_\"Highfanance\"?_\nIs that a window made in to a door? \n\nSuch an odd door opening.

I'm growing a wimpy doofus, meanwhile Chunks is going to take down bank robbers.\nundefined\nThis video makes me want to go build a workshop, learn how to use it, and build chunks his own ramp. Just as she walked the ramp of my heart. \nStep one: find plywood. \n\nStep two: put plywood in doorway, make ramp for baby dog. \nthe dog is female. says so in the title...\nHey now let's not judge chunks gender\nundefined\nIt's a girl, it's in the title\nundefined\nIsn't that technically bad for a English Bulldog? \nwhat's bad?\nEnglish Bulldogs are prone to multiple injuries. Movements like climbing is highly advised against as they can result in health problems like a dislocated shoulder. \nModern purebred dogs everyone... \nundefined\nundefined\nShe's adorable, but... how the hell did we get that from wolves??\nChicken Tendies\ni lol'd so hard\nI'm not understanding.\nHad too many Tendies?\nundefined\nPeople bred dogs for visually pleasing features that effectively disable them. It would be like giving fetuses cerebral palsy because its JUST SO CUTE WHEN THEY STRUGGLE LOLOL! See the top comment.\nI don't see anything visually pleasing in dogs like this to be honest. They just look like they shouldn't exist.\nundefined\nundefined\nBecause people like the look. Smushed face, wrinkles, blocky body, big head, massive underbite. So the dogs have been inbred to produce and reinforced and exaggerate these characteristics and in doing so, have doomed the breed. There isn't enough genetic diversity in the existing bloodlines to breed a healthy bulldog. The only hope is to revise breed standards and introduce crossbreeding. \nundefined\nBulldogs have amazing upper body strength! My bulldog George would not give up tonight until he was on the couch. He may have destroyed the base of the couch with his back claws, but hey for 9 years old and 60lbs I'm not even mad!\nJesus, I'm at college and my family just got a baby bulldog. This makes me need to see him\nHow often do you trip on that annoying entrance ?\nundefined\nThat is the proudest little butt wiggle as she walks in the house. \nI just shouted \"GO CHUNKS!\" to the bewilderment of my roommate.\nSaw this video. It was named \"What would happen if humans disappeared\". They say these type of dogs would go extinct within a few weeks. They would become easy prey, and unable to feed because of their short jaws.\nWe have to stop breeding these kinds of dogs.\nSuch a cute little inbred, genetically abnormal puppy.\nCan someone please make a gif with an endless loop of him trying to climb that step? Seems like my life right now\nAwe, they're so cute before they die. \nSheer determination. \"At first if you do not succeed, try, try again.\nChunks certainly did.\nWhomever built that door step had it out for the owners.\nundefined\nI don't know whether to go aww or laugh or feel bad for the little guy for having such a hard time! That butt though ...!\nundefined\ngood god, it looks like a Boston Dynamics robot wearing a oversized dog costume\nI am the only one who thinks this thing is deformed as fuck?\nNice repost.\nIs it just me or are there more people who find the whole idea of breeding mutants like these who can't climb stairs like a proper athletic, smart and active dog would be able to fucking ridiculous? I'd rather take a mutt/mixed breed than a fucking pug, I just can't handle the misery. A persons outlook towards an animal shouldn't only be about how pleasing and funny it is to look at, but it has to also involve respect to the animal as for it's grace and composure. That thing struggling to climb the stairs? I can't respect that. Respect is replaced by pity and hopelessness, because people don't understand how fucking evil it is to breed animals like this, and it's all done for profit.\nI completely agree,  the selfishness and hypocrisy of people is undeniable in this case. Poor animals. \nundefined\nJesus christ we really fucked up wolves, didn't we?\nundefined\nWhy can't people see that these dogs are physically fucked up?\nundefined\nGod these things are so malformed. Cute, but how far is too far when it comes to breeding deformities and health issues in the name of 'cuteness'? \n\"Never give up, never surrender!\" \n\n;)\nThat's the cutest thing I have ever seen\nIt's just a doorstop..\nundefined\nI was completely expecting chunks to do a front flop/somersault into the house\nthis is truly aww material. what a cute pup\nYou need a ramp OP\nGreat pup.

  "text": "My friends foster kitten is killing me with his smiles\n\nI could never be a foster. Foster kitten? You mean *my* kitten? Foster dog? My dog now. Don't give me animals, I will love them forever.\nSounds like a good argument for giving you animals.\nNice\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6zeve8L.gifv\njesus that's a huge gif\nhttps://i.imgur.com/GLDW0VD.gifv\n[How i felt frantically pressing ctrl - trying to see that gif](http://i.imgur.com/XB0kRsy.gif)\nundefined\nThat's how we've ended up with a bunch of cats.\n\nPeople are mostly into dogs where I live and we take care of anything that shows up.  We've had great luck placing a lot of cats, but we keep anything that we can't find a home for.\n\nA couple of months ago a little orange kitten showed up where my dad and I were working.  He was feral and wouldn't let us come near, but he made it *very* clear that he expected to be fed.  He got fed.\n\nThe next day we trapped him and took him home.  We sent his picture around, but couldn't find anyone who wanted him.\n\nIt took awhile, but he socialized nicely.  Not that we needed another cat, but he turned out to be a cuddly and friendly guy.  We're happy to have him around.  \n\nYou can't just tell a story like that and then not post pictures of the kitty. I mean come on, you know we want it!\n[I can't hug every cat!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP4NMoJcFd4)\n\nEDIT: [She's a troll, guys.](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/eharmony-video-bio) And obviously a damn good one. Juuuuust close enough to reality to be perceived as possibly real but incredibly crazy.\nThat's basically me IRL. \nThis girl definitely has that brain parasite that makes people keep lots of cats.  \nToxoplasmosis, just for reference \nThanks\nundefined\nundefined\nCan we please clone kind ppl like you and dad?\nSimilar situation lead us to having four cats and one dog inside and one cat outside. We only went out of our way to adopt one of the cats, the rest of the critters just showed up. The most recent kitty \"addition\" is still up for adoption.\nYou are amazing. That is a tremendous thing you do.\nSounds about right! This is how my fiancée ended up with 6 cats and a dog. Currently fostering a mom &amp; 7 kittens now too. Fighting the insatiable urge to keep one of the kittens now haha!\nI can't believe you couldn't find a home for a little orange male cat. Those are my favorites!  And I thought it was understood that orange males are the coolest and end up being the most laid back and friendliest.  \nALL HAIL UNCLE ERIK\nI'm used to people asking me how I could give up foster pets then one day I decided to count every animal I helped. It's around 80 animals now. I know I wouldn't be able to keep them all, but it's good to do the right thing and give them a start. \n\nThe hardest foster I had was a kitten I found limping in my yard one cold December day, right before a blizzard. I knew I couldn't keep him with my own cat (also a rescue from a very abusive home). I knew just watching him limp around the yard, he would need expensive vet visits, but I did it anyway. 4 surgeries for an abscess that kept coming back but eventually he was well enough to find a home. I love hearing the updates from his owners.\n\nEdit: I thought I would include a picture of Logan. (Now all the feral cats in our area are referred to as \"Loganites\" in his name. I may have spelled that wrong.) He was the hardest foster to give up but he taught me the most gratitude and patience. This photo was taken right before his first surgery on his leg. Now he lives with 4 other cats and is very happy.  http://i.imgur.com/tgryZfk.jpg \nI was mostly joking, but that's an awesome story! I'm thinking about taking a vet tech program so I can help animals in need. I've been jealous of people who get to work saving them for ages, but the intensive studying scares me a bit. Still, hearing about all the good people like you do bolsters my courage a lot, thank you. Oh, and keep up the good work!\nThanks, I'm sure the universe will send another lonely or injured kitten my way, I'll remember to stay positive. I'm used to keeping it far from my public personal life because people don't understand how I can keep 3 pets but foster and not keep others. \n\nSometimes people think I'm the one dumping the pet after rehabilitating it. A friend that ran the rescue said something along the lines like, \"Oh so you nurse it back to health and dump it on someone else? It was more adoptable before when it was injured and sick.\" This was after I volunteered with their rescue for 2 years and I asked for her to post the kitten on their Facebook page to get him adopted. The kitten's medical expenses and surgeries were already paid for by myself and the rescue would keep the adoption fee. It was confusing for me because I always referred to him as my foster because I knew I couldn't keep him. I guess some people look at your for being the less compassionate one for not keeping them.\n\nWhat about maybe going into wildlife rehabilitation? You need to have certain license, previous education experience, and  be apart of a mentoring program. This way there's less pressure to keep the animal because the goal is for them to be released in the wild.  Although, I hear certain animals have to stay, like squirrels. \n\n\nWhat an asshole thing of your friend to say when the reason that animal is alive is because of you. Keep doing what you're doing. Even if the kittens struggle being adopted after, you gave them a necessary start.\nThanks for saying that. It was one of the hardest friendships I ever lost because we did have the animal rescue thing in common and she was married to a long time friend of mine too. \n\nI did the logo for their rescue that they still use today (that took around 6 months due to all the revisions), created art for them to auction for the rescue, helped them with designing the website. We never went away for 2 years, including summers, except to attend rescue events every Saturday and Sunday. That's when we would stand outside and have a huge dog on a leash hoping to get it adopted. Some days it was exhausting. We did home inspections for adopters, called for vet references, and even drove dogs on transports. I even painted individual dogs on the mural in her expecting son's bedroom when she was pregnant. All because we were friends and doing it together. I was so happy to have friends that were caring and compassionate people.\n\nIt also was hard that I donated so much money to their rescue and they never even offered to help with the surgeries despite all the kickerstaters and gofundme I helped out. So as a friend, she knew that our finances were in really bad shape due to my health. It was already difficult spending a lot of our savings on a foster that I knew from the start we couldn't keep. I tried to tell myself it was the right thing to do, but hearing my friend say that made me question everything.\n\nHearing her say that I was a person that could dump their pet, that was probably one of the cruelest things anyone has ever said to me because it goes against my core values as a human being. The fact it came out of someone that knew me very well, just broke my heart on the spot. I cried myself to sleep that night because I lost my close friends that I had for a decade and a foster cat I spent my savings on and got attached to. It was a hard day. I sent my friend an email saying that if she cared about my friendship, she could have kept certain things to herself and politely said no instead of making the situation worse. We haven't spoken in 6 years. There's just a line that you don't cross and for me that was it.\n\nTLDR: My ex friends suck. They could have spared my feelings while I was going through a difficult time by keeping certain things to themselves and politely said no when I asked for help.  Given our past and all the work that I did for the rescue she started, I thought that would be enough to prove I wasn't a person that would dump their pet.\nWow. That's a really tough thing to go thru. But regardless of how your former friend treated you, *you* know you're doing the right thing. You seem like a selfless, giving and self-aware person and to have helped over *80 needy animals* says so much about you. I'm like a lot of other people here in that fostering would be difficult for me because I'd want to keep them all. I hope you keep doing what you've been doing. You've changed hundreds of human lives and nearly 100 animal's lives for the better. As for your \"friend\", it's a shame she failed to realize what a wonderful person you are. \nThanks for saying that, I really do appreciate it. I guess I didn't realize that it was a one sided friendship or at least she didn't appreciate how hard I worked as a volunteer to make her rescue successful.  \n\nThe one thing I hated that she did was shame the people that were surrendering their pets. One guy had a terminal brain tumor and had months to live. It was pretty public with people raising money for him and his son. Yet there she was shaming him as an unknown irresponsible owner in the post to find a new home for his dog. I prayed the guy didn't see it when it was posted on petfinder. I know a lot of people do dump their pets but I know a lot of people get their lives flipped upside down and have to rehome their pets. People in those situations need just as much compassion because they're trying their best to do the right thing too. \n\nIn my opinion she was compassionate, but for the sake of wanting to feel better than someone else. So the work I did as a volunteer meant very little in retrospect to her. So I decided I wanted to try and keep my volunteer work going for the right reasons, even if it meant doing it privately.  \n\nThankfully it's been a slow year with kittens in my area. I think the trap and release is working pretty well with keeping the numbers down. \n she sounds like a hypocrite and an ingrate.  i just wanted to post to support and say that you did and do a  great thing by giving these animals a home, even if for a temporary time.\n There is so much you can do without vet tech training ( not that that wouldn't be awesome).  Contact some rescues until you find one that you like and there are plenty of things you can do to help and a lot of them involve working with animals.\nBefore you invest in an entire program, might I suggest you apply for positions as a Veterinary Technician? I worked as one during college (I wasn't studying Animal Science), and it gave me really good experience in the field. Most duties in an animal hospital don't require special licensure like those that a Veterinary Assistant would have - until you get into things like assisting with surgeries and administering controlled substances.\nI'll look into that, thanks! But I think eventually I'd spring for the program anyway to free up what I can and can't do. It wouldn't hurt to see if I'd even want to bother, though.\nExactly! I learned pretty quickly that it wasn't for me. I loved it, but I just didn't want to make a life-long career of it. God bless those who do though!!\nI'm right there with you. I've had more than 300 cats come through my house as fosters. I've had one \"foster failure\" (there was no way in hell I was giving him up) plus 2 others. There are several I've cried for when they got adopted, and several I still wish I had kept.  I keep it away from most people, even my family, because all I get for it are jokes and snide comments.\n\nWhen people ask, I usually tell them the way I can give them up is because I know I can save more. Then I show them my list of fosters thar have come through.  Once they see the sheer volume, they start to understand.\n300 is amazing! It's really hard. I've had people try to talk me out of it while I was setting up the safe trap. It's weird when people can't justify showing compassion. I know it's not fixing a huge world problem, but I still know it's the compassionate thing to do. \n\nI came close to being a foster failure 15 years ago. My Dad owned a warehouse in Jersey City, NJ and there was an abandoned warehouse next to his that always had cats. We would feed them and try to trap and fix as many as he could. I imagined that many were pets and their owners died in September 11th because the area is a commuting location for NYC. \n\nThere was one cat that was obviously a pet from that situation. He was a red Persian cat and was just covered in factory oil. His tongue was split into a fork like a snake probably from eating out of a metal can. We had to get him shaved to a lion cut and he was just so adorable, he made his ugly look be the cutest thing. Then he needed a couple surgeries on his mouth so we planned on keeping him while we looked to find him a home. We named him JC after Jersey City, he was the sweetest thing right after he was shaved and we wanted to changed the plan to keeping him. Then we found out that he was FIV positive and couldn't be with the other two cats we had at the time.  That was heartbreaking. Knowing this cat was once a beloved pet  that went through hell and not being able to help him more was difficult. Plus he was a senior and I knew he wasn't the ideal candidate for adoption, but we worked really hard to find him a home. A woman that had a blind dog took him in for his final years. \nhave you ever visited your old fosters and have them go apeshit recognizing you?\nOnly one dog flipped out when I revisited her. She was a total temporary foster because I could barely keep up with her. We had her two weeks. \n\nDuring that time she had explosive diarrhea and went into heat. So we spent a lot of time outside near my local park, but it was clear this dog wanted to walk at least 10 miles a day. I usually do a 5 mile run every morning. I was taking her on that route 3 times a day and I lost 15 pounds trying to keep up with her. Also, it was clear she was obsessed with squirrels and we had a chinchilla at the time. We had to keep them separated and I never even tried to bring her to the area of the house the chinchilla was in or even thought about introducing them for the chinchilla's safety. \n\nSo I made sure to find her a home with a lot of yard, a very secure fence and no small animals. The people that we placed her with needed some help with making their fence more secure, so my husband and I helped out with that one weekend when we revisited them. She lost it and nearly knocked me over. \nYou have a job that I thank God that I don't have to do. My heart starts to rip when I think of all of the animals you take care of and willfully give away. \nWell, I don't get paid. It's purely volunteer and animals that come into my life somehow. (A lot of the cats come because we live near train tracks and that attacks them to hunt the area for mice.) If anything I'm grateful for my awesome vet that cuts me a discount! I try not to think of it as me giving something up, I'm giving them a life and helping them find a home. So a large part of being a foster is getting an understanding of the pet and seeing which type of home or people they would be a good fit with. Making it so the next home is the last home is a gift to myself. \nMy mom fostered a mama cat and her kittens about a year and a half ago. I was completely okay with the fact that they weren't going to be ours, until my mom said she was thinking about keeping a couple of them. Immediately,  a switch flipped in my head and I really really wanted kittens. She ended up keeping the two runts of the litter and I'm so happy to have them around.  My mom insists she did it for me and that I'm taking them with me when I move out. I'm probably okay with that. \n\nIn short, I think I would have a hard time giving up foster animals too.\n\nEdit: bonus pic: http://i.imgur.com/YUeKUXJ.jpg\n\nThe one with the orange face got adopted, the other two are the sweeties we still have &lt;3\nI like the cat that can smile, it must know a lot.\n\nIve tried fostering 2 dogs, screwed up gracefully\nI used to think that too, but then I started fostering. It is SO hard to give them up, especially the first one. My god I felt like someone ripped my still-beating heart out of my chest. It's like a piece of you goes away... but then it slowly gets better and you realize that you did a beautiful thing. You saved a life, you helped make room for others to save even *more* lives. How many among us can say something like that? How great would the world be if we all just did a little more to help those that can't help themselves? \n\n\nI still foster, and some days I wake up cursing myself because I have 3 dogs and a cat of my own already. But, at the end of the day, it's worth the effort and emotions. You take it in stride with a sense of humor. We're only here for so long, so we  might as well pack as much as we can into our little stay to do the most good. \nI started fostering in January, the first one I had was a tiny kitten covered in fleas that weighted 500g, I even had to force feed him the first few days. It was incredibly hard to see him go, I don't have kids but I imagine giving one away would feel quite similar. It took me a while to recover, I cried for days. But then his new mum started sending me some photos and I realised we had done a good thing. \n\nIt also gets easier with time, we've now had 6 adopted out and even though it's really sad to see them go I know they go to good homes and we make room to help more kitties.\nSounds like you know yourself better than I knew myself before I started fostering. I had one cat. I now have three cats. There is no returning of foster kitten siblings, that's just not a thing.\nThat's why we ended up with 4 senior rescue dogs in no time. Can't foster. Must adopt...\nBetween this comment and your username, I think we should be best friends. Just saying.\nIt can be really hard to return them, but by returning them I keep making room to help others. The foster coordinator at the shelter I volunteer at has seen me cry a few times, but it's so rewarding when a kitten that came to you completely unadoptable finds a home.  I have 2 right now I've had since July 10, going back 9/25 and I know that's going to be a really tough day. I decided to bake the shelter staff brownies so I can be flnativegirl that makes the great brownies instead of flnativegirl the big crybaby.\nMy cat, was this way. I picked her up unexpectedly travelling in the aftermath of blizzard. Found this kitten huddling exhaust pipes in a gas station trying to stay warm. I took her back with me to my city after not being able to find an SPCA or any type of society out in Delaware. After about a month of trying to get her healthy (fur/whiskers growing back, deep infection in the lungs cleared, spayed) my intent was to put her up for free on craigslist to help her find a home easier than most. And after a couple of weeks it was clear - she was never leaving.\nThat's exactly what happened to me. I was given a foster kitten. 2 days later I decided he would be mine forever. 3 months later I think it's the best decision I could have taken.\nIt's hard for some people. We just got our last foster dog adopted on Sunday. My wife and him became so attached. When we pulled out of the driveway of his new home, he ran up to the window adjacent to their front door and my wife started crying for 15 minutes straight. \n\nI on the other hand am glad he's gone. He destroyed two sets of blinds and took a dump in the master bedroom closet, which I stepped in.\nI fostered 3 dogs. \n\nI now own 3 dogs.\nMy partner wont let me bring anything home to foster coz he knows well end up with 10 cats. \nThat's how I ended up with my third cat....was supposed to be a kitten to foster and he never left.\nI hear ya. My friend raises service dog puppies and she has to work really hard to not become attached. She keeps them fro 8-9 months, then just gives them back. That would not be me. It would take me about 10 minutes to fall madly and completely in love and end up with a very smart, well-educated house dog.\nWe took in a kitten to find it a home a couple weeks ago. Found it a home INSTANTLY. Ours. \nFostering was perfect for me. I had lost my first dog a couple years prior and was thinking about getting another, but really struggled. My house was so clean now... I didn't have to race home from work now... didnt have to pay a dog walker... and my old dog was a really fantastic, kind hearted lovely, loyal dog so no other dog measured up. \n\nFostered the first one but he was miserable in the city, and a little cray but soooo photogenic. Traffic-stoppingly beautiful. He was adopted in like a week and I was happy he was headed to the burbs. \n\nSecond one was absolute heaven. Sweet as hell, adorbs, chill. Until I left him alone and he pissed in my bed, on my down comforter THREE TIMES. He was not going to be happy in my house either, so I was delighted when he found a good home in like 2 weeks. Coincidentally his new people re-named him the same name as my dog that died. Just knew he found the right fate. \n\nThird guy, omg. He was hard to let go of. Cuddly, sweet, soft, friendly, docile, loyal, so handsome, so chill... man I wanted to keep him but was getting a roommate and knew it would be too much in the house. A friend adopted him so that made it a bit easier. \n\nWound up seeing a pic of my current baby on a shelter's website and just knew he was for me. No fostering needed. Instant family. He's perfect. \nMy last name is Foster :/\nundefined\nhttp://imgur.com/GJbciuV http://imgur.com/gBGW7QJ http://imgur.com/z2Jj7Vz http://imgur.com/lYSV4SA\nomg \u0001F495\u0001F495\u0001F495\nLooks a bit like my cat when she was little!\nPictures of your cat when she was bigger? \nSphinx https://imgur.com/gallery/ocUry\nshe purrdy, grats\n&gt; purrdy\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BbgL7x3.gifv\nYour cat looks a lot like my [cat](http://i.imgur.com/rHW9gyg.jpg)! \nYour cat is gorgeous!\nundefined\nA kitten? \nOMG\nThat second pic.

So adorable!\nCat smiles are just too damn cute for me.\nThe closed eyes genuinely is a cat smile.  It's a trust gesture, I don't need to watch you, you don't need to watch me.\nWhat an adorable little squish.  :D\nYou still alive?\nThey're posting from the after-life.\nHe has the perfect :3 face! \nWhat are you going to name him?\n\u0001F3B6 Killing me softly with his smile.\n\nKilling me softly with his smiiiiiiile. \u0001F3B6\nYou mean your new cat is killing you with his smiles?\n\n¦3 \nThat's the sort of smile that says I may have just farted but am waaaaay too cute for you to do anything about it. \nPeople that foster animals are helping them avoid time spent in a big cement room filled with cages. \n\nSo far, I've only had one foster failure. \nI foster and my local shelter has swanky-ass two-story cat condos with shelving. No cage. But it's still a shelter, and when you're surrounded by strangers in a new place with the sound of stupid doges constantly howling a room over, it's nervewracking no matter how nice your condo is.\n\nI foster the most difficult ones. They've all gotten adopted.\nKitten looks like it just smoked the dankest blunt \nI read FROSTED kitten and was terrified LOL but now I see it's cute smile and I know it's all being well take care of ;)\nfostering is the best thing ever. \n\ni never had any trouble giving them up afterwards, because from the get go I know they go to their forever homes and that was the deal. I think i've had probably 3 dozen kitties go through my home by home. \n\nuntil recently. One adopted me. :\\ She was supposed to go to someone's home for an extended visit and get adopted. But the lady went on vacation for a month. After that, kitten went into heat and the new potential mom wanted nothing to do with her. So kitten stayed with me a little longer, got spayed, and was supposed to get picked up by new mom after her surgery. Then the adopter never emailed back to get the time and location. Then she said she can no longer adopt. Then we found out through the grapevine she bought a kitten from a pet store. \n\nI was pretty enraged. This kitten was the sweetest, snuggliest, softest, purriest, gentlest kitten I have ever encountered foster or otherwise. One time I was trimming her nails and she meowed sadly and squirmed away, and I said hey come back c'mon let's get you not so sharp, and she came back onto the table to let me finish. This is how gentle she is. And she's rejected by this flaky lady!!\n\nAfter all this messing around, she's no longer a kitten. During this long process the organisation also had to turn down other applications to adopt kitty. So now she's lost her \"youth\" card AND she has no home. \n\nSo i did the honourable thing and adopted her. Didn't plan on it that way. :\\ cats pick people I suppose\n:3\nThat's the face my kitty makes after he farts. \nKitty is very content\n＾ー＾にゃ～\nI can't tell the number how many cats i have taken care of as a kid. Too bad I live in tiny apartment now, and dont have space for animals.\nSo when do you take him home? =D\n\nHe is adorable and so fluffy!!\nhow he do that face\nLove this little guy! I have 3 rescues of my own, 2 of which are kittens. All of mine were abandoned or feral at some point but now love me to death :)\nWHAT? He's adorable. Adopt him!\nHahaha very funny angel \nLul!\nIt's too bad it's not white and can't walk on its hind legs, would have made a nice Korin cosplay.\nUmm. Steal him. You *need* him. We won't tell.\nMy mom fostered a dog for a little while. Finally after the third call, and third excuse as to why Winston wouldn't do well in their home, she told the shelter to just take him off the list and that she was adopting him. \nI VOLUNTEER AS ADOPTER! \nThe kitten is telling you to turn off the freaking flash.  \n\nMight be because you're pointing the flash of your camera in his eyes, fuckin idiot\nHe dreams of watching the milk :)\nMogwai\nHe's a cutie. \u0001F604\u0001F497\nPerfect face.\nIts Tran!!\nWhat a gorgeous creature!!\n\"yeeeeeeeee\"\nKilling me softly with its smile...\nR.I.P. OP\nTotes adorbs. \nI think you might just be allergic to cats.\nheheh Kittens are actually Very cute but this one wow\nIt's so adorable, I can't believe it.\nThis cat looks exactly like ours, when we adopted him. \nLooks like Good Guy Greg Kitten!\nYou're killin me, Smalls! \nIt knows....\nZen kitty\n:3\nLook.at that smile.too cute\nI love to smile at my cat. Cat owners will know the slow blink that they do when they \"smile.\" \n\nIf you blink slowly at almost any cat they will do it back to you. You can make friends with a nervous cat by looking at them and doing a slow blink and then look away. It's a sign of non-aggression in cat world and it can really bring a nervous cat on side.\nOh my god this made my day!!\nSO freaking cute!!!!\nhow cute is this?\nBeautiful kitten \u0001F495\nOh my god, so cute!!

Invest in golden retriever puppies. Their value raises exponentially in under a year. Buy low, sell high, in pounds that is.\nPounds indeed. That's how they end up getting filled up shortly after every christmas.\nundefined\nMy guy is 10 months old. Few words of advice. \n\nNibbling / gnawing on your hands is not cute. Don't let him or her do it at all.  Golden's are stubborn walkers.\n\n Leash train, properly from the beginning or you'll end up with a guy like mine who just lays down when he doesn't want to leave the dog park.\n\nMake them work for their food. I wish I did this more. My golden isn't food driven, which has made training absurdly hard. He likes other dogs and people more than he cares about treats. He doesn't know what it's like to be hungry.\n\nPlenty of stuffed animals. Golden's love to run around with stuffed toys.\n\nHug the shit out of it. The first 6-7 months are a lot of fun If you do it right.\n\nAnd they get big QUICK!!  My guy is over 80 pounds of fluff.\nI have a dog that isn't food driven. When he does something right, I throw him a party: : \"GOOD BOY, YOURE THE BEST, I WAS A FOOL FOR GETTING ANOTHER DOG.\" Over several humiliating walks, he got the concept. He's now knowingly disobedient instead of confused, fwiw.\n[deleted]\nThat sounds incredibly demanding!\nThere's a reason people sometimes call their dogs furry babies. \nundefined\nThis is pretty good advice even for non Golden Retrievers.  My dachshund benefited from advice like this.  And he's 15 pounds of pure energy -- Although he thinks he's as big as your Golden Retriever, and would do anything to prove it too. lol.\nI just withhold ~a cup of food in the morning and make it up as a reward throughout the day. It's easy to make them food driven; you control portions.\n\nI'm not saying emaciate the dog, but they don't drop dead the moment you let him get a little hungry so he pays attention to you when he should.\nNah, some just aren't food motivated. I had one that would reluctantly eat the food in her bowl, and treats throughout the day seemed more like a chore than anything else. \n\nShe was healthy and I tried every food under the sun, she just didn't care for food. \nundefined\nMy parents keep saying to watch my floorboards for chewing. Hah. I grew up with two goldens, lovely pups.\n\nWill definitely look to find some local dog training classes. \nWhen I was a kid, my parents, neither of which was really qualified to have a goldfish, let alone a retriever, came into possession of a golden retriever.  The dog never received any note-worthy training, I'm not even sure our trailer (important later) had a leash.  This dog on at least two separate occasions ate through the drywall of the trailer until she hit the aluminum siding for the outside.\nundefined\nundefined\nYour golden isn't food driven?? Is he broken??\nDude, I wonder that all day. Hes more people (other than my wife and I) and other dog driven.\n&gt; Plenty of stuffed animals. Golden's love to run around with stuffed toys.\n\nso much this. If my golden can't find one of her toys she typically switches to socks. There's always something in her mouth until the moment she needs her mouth to eat something.\nMy cousins Husky sounds like your golden, especially in the food dept. And when he got sick, it made it absurdly hard to get him to consume food (to get healthier). Not saying it's going to happen to yours or any dog with that problem. But it was a major hurdle with his recuperation \nundefined\nundefined\nReading these comments, I believe if I ever get a dog, Golden Retriever it probably going to be.\nBe aware that you're signing up for years of regular combing and fur care.\nYou have to manually get rid of the loose undercoat has,  or else you'll find them in every corner of your house.\n\nEven if you do this, it won't eliminate the fur shedding. You'll only decrease it a bit.\n\n\nThey're lovely buggers though.  \n\"I'm part of something, yay\" is so spot on for them.\nFor what it's worth they usually love being brushed or at least ours growing up did. And she liked getting vacuumed too which really helped with the loose hair especially if you did it after brushing her! We legitimately put her outside half the time when we actually wanted to vacuum (if she wasn't already there) just so it wasn't a half hour doggie vacuuming ordeal. \nundefined\nKeep in mind that there is no breed I'm aware of that will look to you with as much devotion and love in their eyes as you tell them not to do something and *immediately* set out to do it as soon as your eyes are off them.  Then pretend they don't know why you're upset and guilt trip you for fussing at them.\n\nGolden's are a perfect example of how breeding for friendliness is sometimes opposed to loyalty.  Sweet dogs, but far smarter and willful than they let on.  It's part of their \"look cute and dumb and maybe this will all blow over\" strategy.\nPlease post to /r/goldenretrievers we can never have enough puppy pictures. \nIt actually came from there. [Simba, the glorious golden!](https://www.reddit.com/r/goldenretrievers/comments/53b0za/simba_the_glorious_golden/)\n\nOP please give credit if you haven't already in a previous comment.\nThe funny thing is OP flat out[ says in that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/goldenretrievers/comments/53b0za/simba_the_glorious_golden/d7rm70y) that he's going to repost this picture and then still doesn't give credit.\nundefined\nFor some reason that dog reminds me of [Sophie the cheerio dog](https://youtu.be/r4Wyquoqlp8).\nundefined\nundefined\nYou bet :)\nundefined\nNaw they are little cute balls of destruction for the first 2 years then the best dog you will ever own. \nundefined\nWe had a free standing tree house while growing up that had a ladder, slide, and rope. When our golden decided she had enough of stick-sword fights for the day, she would climb the ladder and bark at us to join her in sliding down the slide. Then she would jump up and grab the rope and swing from it by her mouth  (terrible, I know, she was fully grown). Coolest dog ever. She also enjoyed jumping on the trampoline and dragging whole, dead trees out from the tree row behind our house and around our yard\nI had always heard about how awesome they are but only recently was actually around one.

Our friend's Boxer puppy immediately became the most outgoing one of the litter when she was placed first and was the only puppy to be wearing a collar.\nWhen my dog doesn't want to come down the stairs I just say come get your bandana and he comes running. \nThat's what my wife does with me expect I don't really have a wife and I'm  so fucking lonely. \n&gt; expect \n\n\nundefined\nundefined\nmy doggo loved in equal parts both naked time and putting his suit on (his collar.. haha). he had really thin hair, so we got him sweaters and jackets and whatnot... lil dude would head outside and strut around with his head high and chest pushed out. just loved it. he knew he looked good  XD\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nFarmer here. Looks ok in the photo but make sure the girls know to only put the hair tie around hair and not circling the end of the tail bone. Elastic bands are how we remove horns, tails and testicles on many farm animals. Known a few horses who have lost tails on accident to overly tight tail wraps and such. 10 out of 10 on the braiding skills though. \nMy childhood dog almost lost his tail for this reason. I was a very stupid 4 year old and wanted him to look pretty. I can still remember how devastated I felt knowing I had hurt my best friend. \nYikes, I didn't even realize this was a thing. I narrowly avoided that by using barrettes all over my dog's fur because braiding a dog tail never occurred to me. \nundefined\nSo tight that it would cut off circulation? \u0001F628\nYes, it doesn't take much pressure to cut off circulation, and doesn't take very long with no circulation for the tissue to die. \nundefined\nundefined\nAh, Goldens. I want another Golden. I hope to have one someday!\nI think I'd like a Golden Doodle, that's gotta be the best of both worlds :) you get amazing personality from both, deep loyalty and friendship from the retriever, and high intelligence from the poodle. Plus hypoallergenic! \nMight have a harder time braiding the tail though.\nI have a Goldendoodle, and he's just the sweetest thing. Golden Retriever gentleness, Poodle smarts. And he's not hyper or anything. I can tell he could be an active dog if he had an active family, but he's fine just chilling in the house since we all just chill in the house. He never chews anything up, doesn't bark at every leaf that blows by, but he still guards and he'd absolutely protect us from any dangerous people if there was ever a break-in. \nI have a toy poodle and refuse to believe that \"poodle smarts\" means intelligent.\nundefined\nOr the destructive hyperactivity of a poodle, and the allergies of a golden. It's a two-way street; you can just as easily get the worst of both worlds. \n\n\nThere's also the fact that many \"breeders\" aren't careful about the genetics they're working with (potential inbreeding, increased risk of certain illnesses, etc), while many more are neglectful of their animals' health (think puppy mills). \n\n\nResearch the breed and the breeder before you buy. There are too many doggos in shelters because their \"family\" was expecting a perfect little angel dog, got something a bit more difficult, wasn't prepared for the effort or upkeep, and gave up on them. \n\n\nOh, and speaking of upkeep, doodles require a LOT of it. You HAVE to brush that coat every single day, or it WILL mat. Matting is uncomfortable for the dog (think tangles pulling at your own scalp), and can, in severe cases, attract yeast infections. \n\n\nPS--there's no such thing as a truly \"hypoallergenic\" breed, so if you're allergic to dogs, and planning on getting a dog, be prepared to have allergy attacks. They're going to happen. \n&gt;Or the destructive hyperactivity of a poodle, and the allergies of a golden. It's a two-way street; you can just as easily get the worst of both worlds. \n\nI saw a Husky Pomeranian cross on here a few weeks ago. The dog was cute as hell but holy crap could things go wrong. All I could imagine is a high strung, yapping, 30 pound, destructive, strong willed terror. Not to mention the  shedding, oh god the shedding. \nWhat's worse is there already is a recognized breed for those that want a small husky that went through the right ways of making a breed (rather than just taking two dogs and breeding them and calling it a day), the Klee Klai.\n\nHey, I think I technically have one of these Pomskis. My mutt has husky and pomeranian (Ok, so it's just 1/8 pom and I think she's 3/4 husky but her grandfather on her mom's side was a pom/rat terrier cross - the mother of my dog was a pup from the guy's husky that he kept. The husky he owned got together with his parent's dog. Which is how I know who the grandfather is, even met the dog. The father of my dog is in question though cause the mother got out and had fun with a lot of male dogs so the litter coudl have all different fathers, one was a husky though and my dog looks more husky than almost every half husky I ahve seen. Happily, the guy finally learned his lesson to spay his pets. I always threaten to tell people she's a rat terrier mix when they ask what kind of dog she is because it's technically true and people wouldn't believe it).\nI imagine the Klee Kais are still extremely high energy though, right?  I really want a Husky (well, adopt a husky mutt, rather) but I live in a condo and that would be cruel to that breed, so I'm holding off until I can guarantee I have enough space for the Husky temperament. \nundefined\nundefined\nhttps://imgur.com/a/VRNHR\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/C2q9u\n\nYes. The black one is a Labradoodle, puppy is a goldendoodle. \nHow's the shedding?\nThey aren't supposed to shed. Even though mine does. But he's a first generation so he's a little more lab then poodle. He looks like the black one in that pic\nVery light, maybe 10% of a what a lab sheds. Goldendoodle still has puppy coat, but it's curlier and should be less \nundefined\nThat's not how breeding works. You don't automatically get the best traits from both parents \nI have a golden doodle. He's very intelligent and also extremely loyal. His name is Wolfgang. \nHis name has a lot to do with that. \nundefined\nWell pack it up guys! Genetics has been proven wrong. Award this guy a nobel prize for his contribution to science. \nDid I mention he doesn't shed \nundefined\nundefined\nI have yet to meet a doodle I like (worked at a kennel for a year). Most that I've met are stubborn, difficult to train, and a bit reactive. They only like to do things on their own terms.\n But they can be pretty cute.    \n\nI'm in love with goldens' personalities and poodles can be great if you train them/exercise them properly. But not a fan doodles. Most of them come from BYBs (backyard breeders) who just want to make money, so they put little/no thought into the health and personalities of the pups. They just throw an ad on Craigslist requesting a dog to breed with. This results in sick and short lived pups. A lot of the time they're anxious and touchy (personality is very important when breeding) and then they wind up in the pound because of something like the owners having a baby and the pooch is territorial, or it requires too much money to hire a trainer. \n\nIt's important to thoroughly research your breeder and make sure the parents have their papers! The pups will be more expensive but you're more likely to get a healthier dog with the proper temperament. There's also the fact you won't be encouraging BYBs to continue their work.    \n\nundefined\nNo shedding is my absolutely favorite thing about my golden doodle. I love animals but I hate their hair all over me.\nMy friend has a GoldenDoodle and it's the dumbest animal I've ever encountered.\nI have a golden doodle, and she's fantastic!\nundefined\nundefined\nMy wife is dead set on getting another Boxer (ours died of Cancer).  I've been working on her to try to get a Golden Retriever instead.  I never personally had one, but everyone says they are the best dogs second to none.\nJust a forewarning, they're kinda dumb. But they are so loving.\nI want a dog that's not going to break our hearts in 7 years when they die of cancer.  Everyone I know who had a boxer got 6-8 years. \nUhh don't look at Goldens then lol. Cancer runs king and so do many other health issues from being so popular. They aren't around long like your dear boxer. \nundefined\nGet a mix of one of the two or even a boxer/retriever mix. Mutts seem to have less health problems like that. \n\n[Golden Boxer](https://dogsofsf.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG_00261.jpg)\n\nAlso, the name \"Golden Boxer\" reminds me of Muhammad Ali and that's pretty cool. \nI've never seen a golden boxer. It's probably dumb as sin but it's a gorgeous dog.\nundefined\nundefined\nReally? The one I had when I was a kid was incredibly intelligent. \n\nOne day when we came home and she was doing her celebratory you're not dead dance, she lifted her nose to bare her front teeth at us. It was clearly not anything aggressive, she just wanted to mimic our smiling. We got excited, told her to smile, and she did it again. Pretty much made up and taught herself the trick, which happened with quite a few tricks she knew.\nundefined\n&gt; My wife is dead\n\n\nThats how i read that too lol\nEspecially with \"died of Cancer\" right after it...\nundefined\nOne of the happiest for sure. They're also simply one of the most common. There are less common dogs that are famous for certain reasons, for example Samoyeds for their beauty\nYour life will never be the same. I didn't even know what true happiness was until I had my first golden. \nundefined\nHow did she manage to do that with a tail?\nThis is a fishtail braid. If you YouTube how it is done you will see. It pulls small amounts from the oitside in. Also my 9 year old niece fishtail braided my hair and it looked great, so I believe an 8 year could do this. Some at least. My 9 year old can't even manage a pony tail\nI wish I had a small little helper to do my hair.\nJust offer candy to children on the street. You'll probably need some room so you should drive a van.\nundefined\nundefined\nDon't forget that it was the combined might of at least a couple little girls that achieved the braid.\nundefined\nNot a fishtail braid, but one of the best [reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tHrUr_ozZs) I've seen for watching how to do a French braid.\nI love that the announcer's name is Denny Directo. Sounds like a cartoon businessman.\nundefined\nI knew I loved Chris Pratt\nI thought the video would have a puppy. Pretty close actually, was not disappointed.\nundefined\nGolden tails usually have pretty long fur on them.\nI think his question was more like how the fuck did they do that with a tail *because it never stops moving*.\nNeither do hyperactive children, if they synchronise then they cancel each other out\nYou're onto something here \nundefined\nMy golden has the \"bang\" trick where you point a finger gun and say bang and she'll fall over. It is always hilarious especially because she'll be perfectly still except for her tail which will be smacking the ground furiously. I'll actually say \"Stop moving your tail. You're dead.\" and she'll stop for a second and then go on wagging away. \nundefined\nundefined\nWait the golden had a sleepover?\nYour dog now looks like a rattlesnake. Its kind of weird but I like it.\nI was thinking it looked like a mermaid tail.  OP, Please post a gif or video of te dog wagging it.\nThe braid is called a fishtail braid!\nDog here: I let my humans braid my tail. I look fabulous. \nThis is fine :)\nAbby...\nBob's Burgers! Love that show.\nStop braiding my mops!\nBut they look so pretty!\nLooks like a loaf of bread on his butt\nI didn't even know this was ^a thing until today\nYes, this is ^a thing.\nNow he looks like a retriever-mermaid\nI'm impressed that her tail stopped wagging long enough to do that!!\nGOD THIS IS JUST SO PURE IM HAVING SUCH A BAD DAY AND THIS HAS CHEERED ME UP TWICE ALREADY I LOVE THIS POSTTTTTT\nWhata champ Haha \nThat's a fishtail braid. So it's practically a merdog now. \nThat's actually one gorgeous golden braided pony *tail*\nundefined\nLooks like you just got yourself a RattleTriever\nAll the Goldens in the duck-hunting blind razz him, but are secretly jealous. \nThat's a great looking fishtail braid! What a sweet dog.\nmy golden has dug this huge hole under our porch that is so deep that we cant even see the bottom of it she really loves digging holes \n\n\nundefined\n\"Who's a pretty girl...? \n\nI am. I'm a pretty girl.\"\nI'm surprised this isn't some sort of weird fashion trend. \nDogpunzel dogpunzel let down your tail\nRapupzel\nundefined\nHow did they even? And what a tolerant dog.\nSomeone call /r/BobsBurgers, Abby the serial braider has struck again!\n\"Fwoosh, fwoosh, fwoosh\" is now \"thwack, thwack, thwack.\" \nWhen you see an upset Golden, run.\nYou should have titled this \"You can tail when the girls had a sleepover.\"\nundefined\nWhat a patient puppy.\nHow did they get its tail to stop wagging to do that? My Golden's tail is constantly moving. \naww I used to try this with my goldie but I was no good and plating\nundefined\nmy puppies love braiding each others hair too!\nundefined\n",

Whoever took the screenshot couldn't just move the cursor out of the way?!?\n/r/nocontext\nundefined\nI got an entire fingernail ripped off by one of those\nSTORY PLS\nSomething similar happened to me when I was younger, somehow the parachute had gotten under my nail and when everyone pulled it up my nail went with it.\n2 people got their fingernails ripped off by parachutes in gym class and found each other online and responded within an hour? Either you two are super clumsy and nearly telepathic or there's a big scandalous lawsuit against parachute-for-gym-class-companies waiting to happen. \nAND IT WAS THE SAME FINGERNAIL!\nDirected by M Night Shyamalan\nundefined\nundefined\nThe parachute industry (big parachute) has been covering this up for years. Why do you think gym teachers still even do the parachute? The answer: they have no choice, gym teachers that try to replace it with something a little more physical/educational are promptly removed and silenced. This thread will now probably be removed as well.\nThey were designed specifically to rip fingernails off as a way to collect DNA for their clone army.\nI hear big parachute what's keeping the military from using jet packs, instead of parachutes. \nundefined\nundefined\nwell i was under it and went to the middle and the edge of my fingernail got caught in the little mesh screen in the center right before everyone at the edge yanked it straight into the air. lots of blood everywhere.\nyikes\nundefined\nIt was 1997, I was 12 years old when a Marlboro sprung upon us from the distant marshy area. The few of us that stayed to fight the beast parachuted like our lives depended on it. Raising the chute as far as we could then disappearing within as soon as the beast tried to cast confuse/berserk. After several tiresome hours, the foul for was defeated at the cost of cursing my finger nail to forever never grow as long as the beast is sealed within.\nI could write a campaign off this. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nI was thinking Hungry Hungry Hippos \nundefined\n[More photos](https://imgur.com/a/KZfuk), and a [bonus clip](https://i.imgur.com/IhRXhtt.gifv).\nDid you stack them to get that last pic? \nNo, they did that on their own. They often climb across each other rather than go around. At the end of the bonus clip you can see another example of that.\nThe thought of you stacking them for the pic made me chuckle.\n\n\"sorry little tortoise friends. papa's gotta stack you for the Reddit karma.\"\nDamn. I wanna be a tortoise munching on some choice flower with my homies... Outlivin stress and bullshit \nDo they have bad eyesight?\nThey see well enough, but since their eyes are side-facing rather than front-facing like ours, they have limited depth perception. And they can see into the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, which is normally invisible to us.\nFrom my experience they can see normally, but they can't really see depth properly, resulting in them biting the air first when they try to eat something.\nundefined\nundefined\nCan... Can I have all of them please?\nYes but make sure to write them into your will because they live like 150 years.\nI was about to ask how it feels knowing you'll be outlived by your pet\nPerhaps you already know.\nouch\nBut I thought you died years ago!\nGhostFish, no!\nSo sayeth the ghost fish\noh man my mom has an african gray parrot that she got when I was in elementary school, and she's almost 70 now\n\nAs rad and smart as he is, I have to say I'm not super stoked about the idea of inheriting and taking care of that bird for another twenty or thirty years\nEspecially when you consider that those birds imprint on and form an extremely close attachment with the person that takes care of them and only that person. If you inherit that bird he'll likely be very stressed out and depressed without your mom around and he'll be a total asshole to deal with :(. \nMy grandma inherited such a bird, a big green parrot named Fred. Well after a few months Fred decided to pluck all his feathers out and dive bomb anyone who entered the kitchen. Fred escaped at some point and we never saw the naked chicken from hell again. I like to think he joined a nudist colony in Florida. Being nine I thought he was the scariest creature alive at the time. Straight from hell.\nSo I hope the inherited bird goes well for ya.\nIf he plucked his feathers out, he was probably either feeling isolated/lonely due to lack of social contact or was extremely stressed. \n\n):\nJust share your xannies with it.\nundefined\nundefined\nFuckin classic Fred.\nundefined\nI think many prospective owners don't realize how long parrots and their relatives live. It ain't like some budgie that expires in 10 years or so.   \n\nNot to mention that parrots and the like are incredibly emotionally dependent on socializing with their owner. Afterall, in the wild they make lifetime bonds with a single mate with pretty much a 100% fidelity rate.\nThat's the thing that really kinda gets me. This bird loves her and thinks he's her mate. Or rather, her mate - we thought he was a male for twenty years until she laid an (infertile) egg two years ago. We still think of her as a him. \n\nAnd going into it, my mom knew all about how long he'd live. Mom is crazy into animals, ran away from home when she was 13 to work at a dog kennel, runs a sheep farm now even though she's post-retirement age, etc. We had crazy  pets growing up - hedgehogs, flying squirrels, chinchilla, snakes, lizards, a mountain of dogs and cats,  etc.\n\n And to her credit, like, when I was a kid, the conversation was always, you know, hey, you're going to inherit this bird we all like one day, you're cool with that, right? And being a kid who liked Lord Admiral Nelson Horatio the Third, I was always like \"sure!\" \n\nThese days the conversation is a little more like \"hey, you're still good to take care of this bird, right?\" and I'm more like \"s...sure? I mean, my apartment probably won't allow pets and I'm not so sure this guy wouldn't literally bite one of my fingers off if I tried to touch him but...sure? Listen, mom, I'll definitely do my best, ok? Hopefully it won't try to vomit into my mouth the way it does to you?\" \n\nI'm gonna really try for this parrot, and hopefully my sister might get interested since she wants to own a rural property and a bunch of animals like my mom does, in which case, you know, problem solved. Worst case scenario, my mom's already fostering two other cockatiels who's owners passed on, and while they haven't bonded to her, they seem to be pretty ok most of the time, so there might be someone out there who can repay the karama. \nOkay Arzen, never fear.\n\nIt's not that the bird is ONLY her mate forever.  That's really not how it works.  Trust me.  Birds can bond to more than one person.\n\nDo you get along with the bird now?  Like, can you hold it and pet it?  If so, you'll be fine.  If you haven't tried ... now is the time to work WITH your mom to get the bird to bond with you, too.\n\nIf it turns out that no one in the family can take the bird, be VERY CAREFUL trying to find it a good home.  I'd take it in an instant.\n\nI was raised with parrots and grew up with a grey that sadly, (not due to anything we did ... someone was temporarily watching the bird while my parents were looking for a house after moving back from Europe) escaped and could be retrieved and I was heartbroken.\n\nBut there are MANY sleazy people out there.\n\nRemember that parrots are worth a lot of money.  But that sucks because they are such WONDERFUL companions and because they are worth money, sleazeballs will look to take them off your hands for cheap or as a \"favor\" (and they pretend to be good people) and then the birds wind up sold for more money and in bad circumstances with people who do not have patience or understand their habits.\n\nIt's time to be honest with your Mom, too, if you aren't sure you can take on the bird.  Maybe she has someone else in mind and she's waiting on you to make the first suggestion.  You never know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the response! I'm comfortable talking with her and she knows my living situation isn't ideal to suddenly adopt a parrot, but both our circumstances will probably change significantly in the next decade so neither of us are worried about it for now. She also has (currently) ~20 sheep, a couple dozen chickens, ducks, and three dogs under her care, and we've talked about the idea of fostering them if something happens and even drawn up a will so we won't be locked out on probate if something sudden happens.\n\n So how it turns out will probably be determined by how me and him get on. I've taken care of him for a couple weeks in the past, changing food/water/newspaper, etc without letting him out of his cage, and he definitely knows me, recognizes me and is comfortable talking to me and letting me get my hands near him, feeding him, but I've never tried letting him perch or petting him, so I guess we'd see. \n\n They're across the country from me, so sadly my current opportunities  to bond are limited,  but I'm comfortable enough with the idea that if something happens I can keep him relatively well cared for and alive, if not super happy. Thanks for the advice about fostering, if it comes to it, I'll be sure to keep in mind the idea that not everyone who wants to adopt a parrot has their best interest in heart, and if I end up giving him up, I'll keep in touch to make sure he's doing ok. \nundefined\nundefined\nHey it's real good of you to be open to taking the bird in though, so props for that. It's hard enough dealing with aging parents, never mind worrying about their pets. Hope you're doing alright.  \nIn regards to bird care, well, there's a lot of great parrot forums and resources out there for bonding tips and general behavioural information, so I'd recommend maybe looking into that if you haven't already. I'm not sure how often you see the parrot but it might help to try and spend more time around it too, so you're more a familiar face.  Reaching out for tips from people that do rescues/fosters might also lead to good information, given they probably have to deal with lots of birds that aren't bonded to them. And hey uh I'm pretty into birds, so while I'm by no means an expert, I'd still be happy to try and help in any way I can, should you want someone to message about it.\nundefined\nundefined\nMy gramps had one and it died a week after his sudden death. The bird kept calling his name the whole week, refusing to eat and telling his jokes. Sad thing.\nundefined\nI told my mom I don't want her gray and she found another woman who is a vet who will take him. That solved that. Tell your mom because her gray will be better with a bird lover. As much as I like to play with that bird -- who is super tame and let's anyone pick him up and hold him under his wings -- I don't really like him that much.\nundefined\nI bet it would be a wonderful feeling :)\nI hope to be buried with my pet worms :)\nIf not, I'm sure you'll meet a few new ones after a while.\nI grew up in a small neighborhood behind a retirement community and it was kinda sad to think about all the dogs that were going to wake up one day with their owners dead.\nMy mother-in-law died of cancer last year. Her dog is doing okay now.\nundefined\nundefined\nIt's insane to think I'm looking at baby tortoises that might live until 2170.\nIt's even more insane since there isn't a single turtle pictured in this gif.\n\n^(Because they're tortoises.)\n...*you're* a tortoise. \nI like turtles.\nundefined\nundefined\nWell all tortoises are turtles. A tortoise is a land turtle basically. Not all turtles are tortoises though. \n&lt;insert Unidan copypasta here&gt;\nMan I almost forgot about that guy\nWe are all turtles on this blessed day!\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nSeveral states allow you to establish a trust for the care of pets.\nundefined\nundefined\nPrecious little tortillas...\nI'm curious - do yours ever bite each other? Once turtles/tortoises hatch they're essentially on their own; so when we had multiple hatchlings for the first time this season (had two singular hatchling seasons because of jostling during my brother's cross-country moves, etc., these are nearly a year old now though) I was shocked at how downright mean they are to one another! Survival of the fittest for sure - as they've grown we've had to separate certain ones from the group during feeding as they're the most likely to re-offend. Mine are Eastern Box Turtles though (*Terrapene carolina carolina*) but I'll be damned if they're not the cutest, sassy little things.\n\n[The calm before the storm!](http://i.imgur.com/Vga9ykYl.jpg) And that dish is actually the top of a milk jug, if you're curious about hatching size for Eastern boxes!\nundefined\nOMG they're so very cute. Thanks for sharing.\nPlease give them all kisses for me!\nMmm, Salmonella.\nWorth it! \n\n\u0001F922\u0001F924\u0001F643\u0001F61C\nThose are turtles, not salmon. Clearly he would get turtlella. \nundefined\nOh me oh my they are just so cute\nI think the bonus clip is the best. I like the close-up shots of them eating. Are hibiscus super tasty to tortoises?\nThey're super tasty to everyone - have you ever had hibiscus tea? Shit's delicious. \nWow, they really decimated that flower. Is hibiscus just regular food for them, or is it a treat like it is for sloths?\nIt's ideal to have a nice variety of plants. Hibiscus is a good option as long as you rotate it with other plants. \nundefined\nQuestion. Can turtles get fat? Is over feeding a real problem with them?\nKind of, but it's usually shown through pyramiding of the shell. You can see an example of this with the tortoise shown at the end of [this video.](https://youtu.be/yVtGpOY9-vc)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVtGpOY9-vc&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\nYour link doesn't work because of the period. \nundefined\nundefined\nCute little things.\nWhat species are these? I've got a redfoot tortoise that has the exact same eating method (bite -&gt; stomp down on the food -&gt; pull).\nundefined\nundefined\nThe fact that you put them on a plate makes this seem like an exotic meal at a baby tortoise-serving restaurant. They are eating the garnish!\nI didn't think of that. They are just easy to carry this way. :)\nYou carry baby tortoises on a plate, so cute!!! Gif of you carrying them please!\nYes please!\n&gt; They are just easy to carry this way.\n\nThat's why restaurants put foods on plates.\nundefined\n\"I know I asked for my meat rare, but this is ridiculous!\"\nYour not eating your monkey brains Mr. Jones?\nundefined\nWow, thanks for giving me these cuties this evening!  Do you have breeding torti in your garden?  Are you given eggs to incubate, or hatchlings to foster?\nMy pleasure! Yes, I have one pair of [adult tortoises](https://imgur.com/a/fJ7aE) in my garden. The female has been laying eggs since 2007, and [I incubate them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpZ-anK9CII).\nThat's awesome! \n\nThis is probably a stupid question, but when you say they are in your garden, are they trapped in the garden or do they just decide to stay in the garden? \nThanks! First, they are captive-bred pets, not caught from the wild! They are \"trapped\" in a dedicated enclosure, because the rest of the garden wouldn't be escape-proof.\nDo the mother/father have any sort of parental instincts?\nNone whatsoever. The mother lays the eggs, and that's job done for her (certain tortoises might also guard their nests, though). The little ones have to fend for themselves from the day they hatch.\nSo I'm guessing she didn't personally pick that little pup up and put it on her shell?\nNo, that was a staged photo op by me.\nAn op by op.\nundefined\nThat's adorable :)\nundefined\nWhat temperatures do they tolerate? If it's 95f or 15f out do they need to come in the house?\nundefined\nLol they kept knocking down the clock when they were hiding behind it in your hatching video, way too cute/funny, thanks for sharing! \nWE HAVE DEFEATED THE MONSTE- ah fuck he put it back up again. \nundefined\nAwww I love the mommy and daddy!\nWow BEAUTIFUL!!! I don't know much about this species or tortoises in general, but it looks like there is very little if any pyramiding at all - is this something that you worked to prevent or does this species not pyramid as much as others (most sulcatas in captivity i have seen have significant pyramiding. Thanks in advance for your answer!!\nundefined\nOMG that one that was wandering around with half its egg still on its back.\nundefined\nundefined\nSlowest game of Hungry Hungry Hippos ever..\n*hungry hungry tortles\n\n^^herpetologists, ^^please ^^don't ^^destroy ^^me... ^^it ^^sounds ^^a ^^bit ^^like ^^\"hippos\" ^^without ^^being ^^as ^^obvious/goofy ^^as ^^\"tortos\"\nI like tortos\nHerpetologist.. what a terrible sounding field of study.. \n\nIt even comes from the word \"herpien\" which means to creep...\n&gt; \"Hey man, you're a herpetologist, right?\"\n\n&gt; \"Sir, please put your pants back on...\"\nundefined\nundefined\nWhat do you do?? Is this work or just a hobby?\nJust a hobby.\nHow do you keep track of which tortoise is which?\nGood question! I mark their shells with a tiny bit of white nail polish (the upper layer of the shell is basically the same stuff our fingernails are made of - keratin). Some people paint numbers on them, but I don't like that. Well, if you have a large amount of hatchlings, that might be necessary. But I can do with small dots, the position of which tells me who's who. [This here](http://i.imgur.com/ZxvmbIm.jpg) for example are number 2 of the first clutch, number 2 of the second clutch, and number 2 of the third clutch (\"column\" marks the clutch, \"row\" the number).\n\nPlus, I take ID photos of all of them.\n&gt;Plus, I take ID photos of all of them.\n\nYou should print up business cards &amp; access badges for them ala [this](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0739/3611/products/OfficeSpace-Initech_1024x1024.jpg)\n\nAlso, nice relevant username\nI believe you get your ass kicked for saying something like that man\nLooks like somebody's got a case of the Tuesdays\nundefined\nThe Michael Scott technique\nundefined\nneat!\nTheir shells are so nice and new! \n\n\nOut of curiosity, why do you need to know which baby is which? And what is a clutch in relation to tortoises?\nA [clutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_\\(eggs\\)) is a collection of eggs that were laid at the same time, in the same nest.\n\nI need to know which baby is which for several reasons, maybe most importantly to keep track of their growth and weight gain, which tell me if they're doing fine or if something's wrong with them.\nWhen tortoises lay eggs that group of eggs is called a clutch\nI just helped with a population survey in Indiana and we notched their shells. But I guess you don't need to re identify them after dacades so it's probably not worth it.\n\nAlso, I have some freshly hatched ducklings, wanna trade? \nundefined\nThey have names.\nundefined\nOne of them is going to bite the leg off another one... prepare yourself.\nundefined\nThe one in the bottom right pulls its entire body forward trying to take a bite •ᴗ• \nHad to make sure someone else loved that as much as me :3\nundefined\nundefined\nYou just showed me my happy place. \nWhat kind of dogs are these?\nshelled puppers\nThey be slow dogs man. Slow dogs.\nMobile home doggos\nShield dogs. \nundefined\nThis is adorable!  I love baby tortoises. Thank you!!\nThere is something oddly turtulating about this .. \nHow difficult are tortoises to care for? I've heard you have to bury rebar in your yard as they like to dig. What other bits could you share as an owner?\nDepends on the species, your climate, and whether or not you can provide sufficient outdoor space. A big sulcata tortoise can easily tear apart your garden, but Hermann's and Russian tortoises stay much smaller. [Here's my enclosure](http://i.imgur.com/5mV9NEo.jpg) for young Hermann's tortoises, for example. No rebar necessary, the granite slabs go deep enough that they can't tunnel beneath, plus the ground is fairly hard. My mini-greenhouse (coldframe) has automated heating for colder times of the year. For indoor enclosures you'll need special lamps instead (UVB). If you'd like to know more, you could read [this booklet](http://www.tortoisetrust.org/Downloads/Taking_care_of_pet_tortoises_web.pdf), and visit /r/tortoise.\nI got worried about that bird looming over the enclosure for a sec. \n[deleted]\nCrows can indeed be a danger to the smaller tortoises. They've been known to abduct and kill them on occasion. Luckily that hasn't happened to me yet. The enclosure is in a fairly secluded spot, and I cover it with a net when I'm not around.\n\n[As for what they do all day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhzvDfjn6K4): eat, walk around, bask, doze, maybe climb and dig a little... \nundefined\nThe bird is throwing off my sense of scale. Big bird or tiny enclosure.\nI think it's a small enclosure since OP said it was for the young ones\nundefined\nAww that's a really nice enclosure.\n[deleted]\nundefined\nSince its open, won't they be at risk of falling prey? Or is that bird to distract predators?\nLuckily there aren't any real predators around. The bird was meant as a distraction, but I don't count on it. Crows have been known to abduct and kill small tortoises on occasion. Luckily that hasn't happened to me yet. The enclosure is in a fairly secluded spot, and I cover it with a net when I'm not around.\n\nundefined\nundefined\nThey are so tiny! But I still want to hug all of them...\nI am truly pleased to see this video. Thanks for sharing, fellow turtle.\nMy heart can't handle this at all\nUsername checks out. \u0001F422\n\u0001F422\u0001F422\u0001F422\u0001F422\u0001F422\u0001F422\u0001F33A\u0001F422\u0001F422\u0001F422\u0001F422\u0001F422\u0001F422\nHere in AZ, desert tortoises are a very dubious topic. Lot's of people will \"rescue\" them from the wild, thinking they're being a hero, but are ignorant to the fact that once turned over to AZ Game and Fish, they remain in captivity until a suitable adopting home can be found. As a result, many Game and Fish offices are inundated with tortoises that can never find homes, because the regulations for adoptive families are so stringent. \n\nSo my question is this. Do you adopt these animals out? If so, what criteria do you hold to ensure that the homes that they're going to are adequate for the demands of the animal? Is there any concern for the spread of zoonoses between the animals? Is there any risk of the spread of invasive species if/when adoptive homes decide to 'reintroduce' these animals into the wild?\nThese are eastern Hermann's tortoises, or Testudo hermanni boettgeri. They're readily available in the pet trade and although they do require a CITES Article 10 to sell, they're still not quite as vulnerable as desert tortoises. They're also not native to the US, so there's no risk of them being taken from the wild there (although it can and does still sadly happen here in Europe).\nwell would ya look at that\nThe frame rate is amazing! What did you take this on?\nThanks. Just my trusty old Canon EOS 550D / Rebel T2i.\nNo thank you OP for the OC. \n\nI feel like 90% of the stuff in the front page lately is a 45 day old spammer account claiming someone else's Instagram photo as theirs. \nAny tips for getting a hatchling to eat veg?  Mine doesn't want anything but mealworms.\nWhat species?\nundefined\nundefined\nDo they know what that plant is naturally?  Or are they just familiar with flora and went for it?\nSince they are babies, they can't really know any plants at first. I think they're going by instinct, smell and taste.\nTurtles/tortoises also see the color red pretty vividly so they're often attracted to foods with red coloration.\nAnd sometimes go after human toes painted in bright pink or red nail polish!\nundefined\nhnnnggg so cute i wanna die\nhttp://imgur.com/a/O4L8b\nDid it taste good?\nI don't know, I've never tried hibiscus myself. But tortoises love it.\nFry them up and season them and they are a good option for vegan tacos.\n\nAlso very good for tea, both iced and hot.\nHow could a turtle taco be vegan?\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nHibiscus tea is popular in some places but I think it tastes like perfumed grass. If you want to try it, sometimes you can find a drink mix called agua de Jamaica, or just look for hibiscus tea in the herbal teas section.\nundefined\nundefined\nShouldn't they be eating pizza?\nundefined\nAww they look like hungry hungry hippos.\nThis is the greatest thing I have ever seen. \nWow, I remember when ours was that tiny 7 years ago! I wish I had known reddit then and would've consulted reddit more for tortoise care, as we had to have ours operated for three different things all at once (reproductive prolapse, remove reproduction system, remove bladder stone).\n\nShe's doing better now, but it's hard paying that bill ::sighs::.\n\nAny recommendations on bettering her enclosure? She really likes to scratch at her house a lot - it was a wooden dog we converted for her use. Thanks! Your little ones are so cute! (Wait, did I say that already?)\nI could watch this all day. It makes me so happy.\nWait until they are teenagers, pizza all day\nundefined\nThis is the slowest game of Hungry Hungry Hippos I've ever seen.\nIt always confuses me so much when I meet someone who thinks baby tortoises or turtles are frightening instead of mind numbingly adorable. When I was younger, I showed a girl my baby turtle thinking she would due of cuteness overload and instead she nearly had a panic attack just knowing that there was a 2 or 3 inch baby turtle on the lower floor of the house while she was sitting in a closed room on the upper floor.\nundefined\nLiterally, \"Nom, nom, nom, nom\" and nobody else said it?!?\nSOMEONE NEEDS TO EDIT A SCREAMING FACE ONTO THAT FLOWER\nundefined\nThat one at 4 o'clock that stretches its neck out and tries to rip a bit off but just pulls itself forward instead.\nSo cute!\nThat is one of the cutest sights I've seen in a long time. Beautiful quality of the video too. Clever way of telling them apart without taking too much away from their natural appearance.\nAdorable!!!\nSOUND SOUND SOUND I NEED SOUNDS\nI think they are burning more calories than they are consuming like this lol\nThis gif watered my crops, saved my progress and healed my wounds.\nundefined\n",

I'd hardly even call it porn\nundefined\nhttp://i.imgur.com/XHBa71T.jpg\nundefined\nyes please\nbut why? \nWhy not? Just think of it like LARPing. \nundefined\nThey are wild animals, and they don't make good pets, but whoa they are cute in their weird wildness. I work with non-releasable education ambassador owls, and they're the feathery lights of my life. They're alternately graceful and doofy, adorable and ferocious, rewarding and frustrating...but always charismatic, lovely, fascinating, and wild. I don't see them as \"pet\" animals that you can \"have\" or \"own\" - it's more of a partnership, like they're fluffy shrieking colleagues who regurgitate pellets on you sometimes. So yeah, they definitely are fun to watch, and the videos are super adorable, and it's totally legit to feel that way and still understand that they don't make good pets! \nFerocious how?  Towards you? \nThey can grind every bone in your entire hand to a pulp with one foot. Gotta be careful. That's not even taking into account their talons.\nWait so with out the talons they can crush my hand. Fuck that noise.\nThe Great Horned Owl has a grip strength of about 500 psi, which is far more powerful than a Rottweiler bite. For comparison, an adult human can only grip with a force of about 20 psi. The reason owls can grip that hard is so that they can instantly snap the spines of their prey. \nWhat and I don't need to snap the necks of stuff? \nHuman grip strength varies considerably, but it much higher than 20 psi. This study showed that even males with very poor grip strength could generate nearly 90 psi.\n\nhttp://www.topendsports.com/testing/tests/handgrip.htm\n\nHowever, great horned owls have a more powerful grip, making from about 200-500 psi.\n\nhttp://www.adirondackwildlife.org/GreatHornedOwls.html\n\n\n\nThe Great Horned Owl is also nearly completely silent as it attacks, which adds to the terror.  I've seen a few in my childhood, and it's crazy when they swoop in for the kill.\nYep. They're *amazing* predators. Completely silent, and incredibly powerful. Owls usually don't build their own nests, either, so they acquire them by either finding an old, unused nest, or by evicting the previous occupant. Great Horned Owls have been known to kick *Bald Eagles* out of their nests. Sometimes they even kill and eat them.\nundefined\nYeah and the talons are more than capable of tearing your throat out. Don't piss off owls. Or any raptor really. Golden eagles have been known to attack fully grown deer for fucks sake.\nVarious steppe peoples in the 'stans and Mongolia use them to hunt wolves from horseback. Golden eagles go that hard in the paint. \nThey also supposedly carried off Native American children on occasion, though the veracity of those types of stories is questionable at best. But yeah golden eagles are metal as fuck\nI also work with nonreleasable owls at a nature center. All of our birds were hatched in the wild, but were rescued after sustaining permanent injuries (getting hit by cars is *really* common with owls, unfortunately). Even though some of our owls have been in our care for close to 20 years, and many of them have become trained to step onto a glove and do educational programs, they're still very much wild predators, and they remind you of it. If it were up to them, they'd have nothing to do with us. The best we can do is to get them to tolerate our presence.\n\nOwls are generally pretty possessive of \"their\" territory, which in this case, is their enclosure. Our Great Horned Owls hiss, puff up their feathers, and clack their beaks whenever anyone comes into their enclosure to clean or give them food. It's how owls say \"back off, you're in my space.\" Our male Barn Owl does this too, but he's a little more unruly because he's very protective of his mate. I went in his enclosure to feed the pair this summer, and as I turned around to leave, he kicked me in the back of the head with his talons to drive me away from his nest. Thankfully it didn't break the skin (owl talons are filthy and a good way to get an infection), but it *hurt!* \n\nSpeaking of which, when they have eggs (and females *will* lay eggs every year, regardless of whether or not they have a mate), owls become exponentially more unpredictable and aggressive, to the point that our center doesn't even let volunteers or interns in the enclosures while a bird is nesting. That unfortunate job goes to the handful of paid, trained staff, who get to be attacked by the owls. One poor guy got a faceful of owl talons this spring while he was checking the owl's nestboxes for eggs. There were eggs. Owl was not pleased. (BTW, we can't let the eggs hatch because we don't have a permit for breeding, and we really don't want to be breeding owls. We still let the birds \"incubate\", but after swapping out the real eggs for fake ones).\nWhat do y'all do with the eggs that you switched out?  Trash can? Give to other centers that do have a breeding permit?  Or have some killer omelets? \nNot the same person you replied to, but when the broad-winged hawk I worked with (she died in 2014) laid infertile eggs, I blew out the contents and preserved the shells. I wanted to use them in education programs, but we haven't really had a use for them since she died. I'd do the same thing if any of our other birds laid eggs!\n\n...I would be lying if I said I hadn't wondered what a hawk egg omelet would taste like, though. \nundefined\nundefined\nIs the owl playing or just afraid of the person filming?\nSo cats with wings?\nundefined\nI live near a raptor rehab centre that's open to the public. They have a  number of raptors and other birds who can't be released into the wild for whatever reason. One is a tawny owl who was kept as a pet. The owner's kids were kicking it around like a football and broke its wing. He's now a very happy, very relaxed mascot...they don't even keep him in an aviary most of the time. He wanders around greeting everyone. \n\nDon't get owls as pets.\n\nAnd if you live in or near the East of England, go visit the [Raptor Foundation](http://www.raptorfoundation.org.uk/).\nRaising a pet like that seems more like raising a kid: they are yours for a time, then they are theirs. You may hate it, but you can't really do much about it. They still love you, but the ownership aspect is ultimately your issue to deal with, not theirs.\nHearing you describe owls is like the dude in the Pokémon fan club describing rapidash that gives you a bike voucher. \n\nPlease someone understand my reference. \nI got you fam \nI guess when you put up with their bad moments you have the right to show off the good ones\nI'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure.

THOSE CLAWS! \n\nIts all fun and games until he accidentally ruptures your spleen trying to give you a hug.\n\nI've heard that animals with big claws learn how control them so as to not kill their friends/family.\nAnimals with little claws can do it too. A kitten who spends extra weeks with Mom will quickly learn that to use the claws is to get your ass whipped. Got my cats when they were 14 weeks old instead of the usual 6 or 8 weeks. Their claw manners are impecable.\nbut 8 week old kittens tho\nFind a breeder that will let you meet your kittens early. Not only do you get to hang out with a lot of kittens, you also get to see how they're cared for.\nWish we had that choice, we have a rescue kitten, I'm trying the best I can to teach her but she has such bad manners, anyone know what I should do? She's getting better but she was so flea bitten and little I had to take her\nYelp loudly or meow in a high pitch any time your kitty scratches or bites you. She should learn pretty quick from that. It's what her litter mates would do during play to let her know she got too rough. \nThank you! I'm doing that, the begging for food is also an issue, We try to only feed when she should eat but the mewing can be Incessant, my main concern is that I've read a lot that kittens taken away too early become anti social or badly behaved cats, as I say she was a rescue so we saved her at least but avoiding as much bad behaviour as possible would be great! \nYou are correct about bad behavior from kittens taken too young. The reason for this is not the age so much but the fact humans with enforce the bad behavior. When a young kitten gets rough with its mother the mamma cat will put the kitten in its place with a slap etc. Humans will say ohhh how cute! \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nAll they think about is murder.\nDon't we all :)\nundefined\nSame here, got our cat a little later and he won't ever touch you with claws out.\nundefined\nI had a stray cat show up on my porch that I ended up taking in. This is how I know she was someone else's pet at some time. She's great with her claws and lets me hold her feet to clip them. \nI bathe mine and never get a scratch. I also brush their teeth and will jam my fingers in their mouths for no reason, just because I can... but if they ever got out, they would spend their lives destroying the neighbourhood and killing anything they could get their claws on... including people. No one would know they were someone's pet.\nundefined\nundefined\nthat can be an issue for example if you find a kitten and he never got to play with the rest of his litter. that's when they learn not to be rough with their claws.\nI have two cats, one was the runt of the litter and ignored by the mom and siblings. This manifests in three ways:\n\n1. Terrible claw etiquette\n\n2. Gorges himself incessantly\n\n3. When he gets really cuddly (very frequent) and we're petting him he will grind his teeth in a weird quasi-suckling motion while he tries to nibble and suck on our fingers.\n\nHe's seven now btw, definitely an adult. He's definitely a special boy. The second cat is much closer to the center of the cat bell curve, and is very polite with his claws.\nundefined\nI got my kitten a little early and she was the out cast of her litter.\nWe have this huge old Forest Cat named Tubby who took my kitty in and taught her how to not use the claws and such. It was the coolest thing watching this fat old cat running 100 mph chasing after this little kitten.\n\n\nOh! And it was super cute when she didn't know how to clean her self! Tubby would tackle her and start cleaning her :D \nundefined\nWith great power comes great responAAAHHH OMG SAVE ME ASLKDJF;AKJSDHFALKUSDEGFAUEWGFKAJHSBDFKAJSDFHAIWEURAWE\nundefined\nundefined\nI think that bear knows exactly what he is doing. It's like a cat biting you, or a parrot holding your finger in his beak. They know exactly how far they can go without hurting you. \nIve been scratched by many a \"friendly\" cat.  Not sure id want a scratch from ol cuddly there.\nHave you ever been scratched or bit by an unfriendly cat? Even really rough \"play\" scratches/bites are nothing compared to a deliberate attack. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nIt's not just the claws, it's the massive amount of muscle controlling them.\nundefined\nundefined\nI don't see why Leonardo Dicaprio made such a big deal out of this in The Revenant?\nOscar\nNoo, his name is *Leonardo DiCaprio*.\nMaybe Oscar is the bear's name. \nundefined\nLernerner DiCapricorns \nundefined\nundefined\nThat was a black bear and it likely had just consumed wild Cannabis.

Or longer!\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nPolar bears the largest bears on earth, weighing at like 1000-1500 pounds for adult males, so you cannot fight back. They also have little to no human interaction, so people dont scare them. While other bear attacks are usually the result of people startling them, polar bears have been known to actively hunt humans. Theyre stealth killers and have every intention of killing and eating their victim. \nTIL there's a limit on how far north I'll be moving as Earth warms up\nthat's the beauty of Global Warming is that the polar bears will lose their habitat and die off and so you'll be safe. \nOr they adapt and you are all fucked.  \nNot me.  \nI'm Australian.\nUm, you've got enough to deal with down there.\nAt least I can SEE the creature that's about to murder me.\nUnless it snows\nBut we're talking about global warming, so it's all good.\nundefined\nYou can't see a polar bear in a blizzard.\nTIL polar bears are like the wind, you cant see it but you can feel it in your skin.\nundefined\nStop it both of you. I have enough nightmares.\nundefined\nundefined\nLike you need something else in your country trying to kill you. \nMaybe Australia will protect the people from the polar bears. \nHell no,  we have enough to deal with down here without worrying  about some giant,  super stealth bear thank you very much.\nDon't dropbears get pretty big?\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nNot me either.\n\nI'm Russian.\n\nI ride those fuckers like horse.\nundefined\nCome to think of it, the concept of Australian wildlife moving to other parts of the globe is a good way to get climate deniers on board. Do you want Australian ants ? because that's how you get Australian ants..\nundefined\nYes....because you're so safe in Australia. Also, polar bears can swim mate. This means the strongest ones are gonna make it down there as they lose habitat. The earth is selectively breeding super polar bears that will become the deadliest things to inhabit Australia since Hugh Jackman. \nundefined\nYou're fucked all right. Salt water crocs, this spider, that snake, some other nasty killing machine, boxing kangaroos, koalas. All man eaters and or killing machines.\nNot to mention Bogans. Fucking scary cunts.\nundefined\nundefined\nBut what about those drop bears?\nundefined\nundefined\nNot entirely...  because of the warming, Polar bears are being pushed south and grizzly bears north...  [Pizzly bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly%E2%80%93polar_bear_hybrid) are awesome.\nThought they were called [Grohlar Bears] (http://i.imgur.com/hyDyH3z.jpg).\nundefined\nundefined\n:(\nYay?\n[deleted]\nundefined\nLet me tell you about Polar-Grizzly bear intermating and the new terrors that are being produced in the wild because of global warming.  Staying out of the north isn't going to save you, death is coming down south even further than before.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly%E2%80%93polar_bear_hybrid\nundefined\nNah. They are already moving south and mating with grizzlies. We will just have to deal with the hybrid in the future.\nundefined\nundefined\nI live in eastern canada and occasionally one will drift down here on an ice floe from up north, they usually get tranqed and brought back up.\n\nTheyve figured out a way to travel they just need to master it.\nundefined\nWhy do you think America has so many guns? Not because we're crazy.\n\nBecause we're prepared. After the war of 1812 where the glorious US Army lead by General Patton blitzkrieged the Canadians, they were turned back by polar bear mounties. Ever since then, we've been waiting. Watching. Preparing.\nundefined\nundefined\n[seeing as how big that grizzly is in the gif, then looking at this comparison](http://i.imgur.com/g2KFtL5.jpg) - holy shit polar bears are terrifying.\nThey had a polar bear exhibit at a zoo I went too, with a big fake polar bear recreated standing up. It's absolutely terrifying. And then to see the real ones in the water, swimming like they're seals? Downright fucking terrifying to think about.\n\nLeo wouldn't have survived if The Revenant had taken place further north. He would have never even known he was about to be slaughtered.\n[Took this at the San Diego Zoo.  This is a life size replica of their big male.  I'm 5'11](http://i.imgur.com/Fi6KNpV.jpg)\nundefined\nundefined\nIDK. My takeaway was \"grizzlies have longer claws and are better at chasing you.\"\nundefined\nGrizzlies are fast.\n[yeah if one was chasing you, you wouldn't really have a chance.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywe60Nk_dEk)\nundefined\n¿POLAR BEARS CAN WEIGH OVER A TON?\n\nexcuse me while I go hug the equator with all my might\nundefined\nSo I'm guessing black bears are the smallest, which is why it's \"fight back\"? Cause you actually have a chance?\nBlack bears are the biggest pussies in nature. \n\nJust saying \"fuck off bear\" will make them go away\nundefined\nJust [watch this video](https://youtu.be/Bkwy0scRXBU?t=134) to see how timid most black bears are\nThat was unexpectedly cute.\nEspecially when he hugs the tree like a little kid who got caught doing something bad and runs to his mom like \"I didn't do it!\"\nI like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXBjYRjNf7U) the best.\nundefined\nundefined\nNo it's because back bears are scavengers and will eat you if you're dead. Playing dead would just make it easier on them and more inclined to gobble you up. \nYes that's true but usually they prefer to eat plants. Berries, honey, and occasionally garbage.\nundefined\nalso because they really aren't that big compared to other bears or even humans; on average a adult black bear is 4.5 ft and 240 lbs. so while heavy with muscle for their size, they aren't much heavier than the average human adult male, plus they aren't very aggressive unless they have cubs to protect and can be quite skittish, they can even be intimidated by small dogs. \nYes, but the fight back is not related to their small size. Its related to their temperament. I'm pretty sure that it they decide to kill you to kill you they likely could.\nYou can't outrun a black bear, you cant out climb a black bear. Your best option is to look tough and scare it off. \nundefined\nundefined\nI go backpacking in the Rockies a lot and every once in awhile a black bear will wander into camp or across the trail. 99% of the time yelling at them makes them run. The one time I had one that didn't run I just whacked it with my trekking pole and the thing ran off. They are just big dogs.\nyeah just big completely wild super smart super powerful giant dogs \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\n&gt; Theyre stealth killers\n\nThey cover their noses while hunting. How the hell did they learn that?\nundefined\nTheir food sources are limited and often hard to come by so they'll attempt to take down prey much bigger and tougher than any human (without a firearm), [as evidenced by this encounter](https://youtu.be/v6iDtvGbIOU?t=2m).\nMan. I like how the walruses just use the, \"Fuck it, there's a bunch of us and one of him, my odds are pretty good\" strategy. \nundefined\nundefined\nPolar Bears are the biggest land carnivores in the world, so yes, if you encounter one you're pretty much fucked. \nundefined\nPolar bears don't give a fuck.  They absolutely WILL eat you, no matter what you do.  Your only option is to slowly walk away and hope it doesn't follow, then run if it sprints.\n\nEdit: Someone correctly noted that flares, rifles, and other \"weapons\" or distractions are good.  I was specifically referring to being unarmed, as that was the context.  If you're unarmed and a polar bear takes interest, it's better to run than give up and be eaten alive.  Waving your arms to look taller or playing dead are not going to help.\n\nAnd, of course, if you have a flare gun, tazer, or something else, use it, as that will be much safer than running.\nIf you encounter a polar bear, just start burning a bunch of coal while driving a Volkswagen TDI. Apparently global warming kills polar bears.\nWhen the Second Amendment guaranteed the right to bear arms, the people of Alaska took that to mean \"the right to arms that can kill bears.\"\nCan confirm: am Alaskan, own a big gun I take on all hikes.\nInstructions unclear ... selling arms to polar bears.\nundefined\nTo be fair, if I lived up there, I would definitely own a gun big enough to kill a bear...\nundefined\nundefined\nA grizzly weighs 400–790 lb, polar bears weigh 772–1,543 lb and will eat just about anything they find.\nundefined\nundefined\nWe're still talking about bears here, are we?\nBears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.\nMICHAEL!\nundefined\nundefined\nIs it really \"if it's brown lay down\"? That seems..risky. \nBrown bears hunt. They are after live prey. Play dead and you won't look like dinner.\n\nBlack bears are scavengers. They want an easy meal, not one that fights back.\nOnly problem is not all brown bears are brown and not all black bears are black...\nYeah they swap coats every few weeks just to fool us.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nIf the Grizzly bear wants to kill and eat you then you will die. It might be possible to get up a tree or something but you'd have to be really fast. You cannot fight it and it can easily run you down. If you play dead however then you have a chance. Assuming the bear didn't want to eat you and just attacked because you were close to its cubs or something then playing dead might save you. Playing dead is far from a perfect strategy and people have been madly mauled while doing it but of your three choices it's the one least likely to get you killed. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nThe is the Orphaned wildlife centre in New York. Pretty sure that's Jim (Bear) and Jimbo the (larger more furry bear).\n\nThey have a great Facebook page and website is Orphanedwildlife.org more videos are posted there. \nIsn't there another bear with a thing like this? I forget the name of the guy who does it but the bear's name is Brutus and he was still blind when he was found allowing him to imprint on the guy as a parent.\nundefined\nundefined\ni see two bears\nBoth are pretty sexy, as far as bears go.\nundefined\nI can't believe I had to scroll this far to read something like that\nundefined\nundefined\nDruids.\nHype for the UA Ranger rework!\nRoll tide?\nundefined\nWait, what does that mean?\nD&amp;D just released a rework of the ranger class in an online feature called \"Unearthed Arcana\" (that's the UA). Rangers get animal companions to help them in fights, and bears are a common choice.\nundefined\nUnearthed Arcana (UA) is a periodical run by the company that publishes Dungeons &amp; Dragons where they release new options for classes in a semi-official way. Ranger is a character class that can have an animal companion—one of the options for which is a bear—as part of its feature set, but they're widely regarded as the weakest class in the newest edition of D&amp;D. /u/thegreenrobby is saying that he's excited about a coming rework of that class to be published in Unearthed Arcana that's aimed at making it a more viable choice.\n\nSource: nerd\nundefined\nundefined\nDose claws tho\nI wouldn't ask for a back rub.\nYeah, might be smarter to ask for a back scratch for those hard to reach spots.\nHard to reach spots like say liver or other intestines. \nReach so far in your liver becomes part of your intestines. That'll hit the spot.\nImagine the refreshing feel of those strong, sharp, muscled hands running down your spinal cord like a professional Harpist.\nundefined\nundefined\nSeriously those things were made to shred!! How did I not see those before. They are straight up scary.\nI've read articles about bear attacks which emphasise the claw length, but like you I was gobsmacked by the size of the claws on this bear. And reading another link on this post \"about the length of a human finger\". Wow.\n\n\nBears look so adorable but they're massive murder machines.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nAw look at the cuddly bear with its big ol murder mittens \nI see that bear and think \"I love you, too, dinner.\"\nThat is very cute and completely terrifying all at once. \nTest audiences failed to convince Werner Herzog that this ending to Grizzly Man was better. \n\"This interaction between man and bear demonstrates the duality of nature. Yes, it is capable of horrific violence, but it is also capable of the warmest cuddles.\"\nundefined\nFuck he's enormous. That bears pretty big too.\nFather and son.\nundefined\nThe video was shot in fall, both of them are preparing for winter and hibernation. You should see them in spring!\nundefined\nundefined\nJesus Christ, I never realized just how large bears really are. That guy is a big man and that bear's head IS THE SIZE OF HIS TORSO.\nundefined\nThat man has balls of titanium.\nStrong chance \"had\" is the correct word.\nundefined\nThis reminded me of Sulo Karjalainen and Pasi Jäntti at the Predator Center in Kuusamo, Finland. Karjalainen has a remarkable relationship with several bears that were orphaned as cubs and have been in his care ever since. [Here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1xMPHsqtwo) about him. The video is mostly in Finnish, but 12:28-15:38 is in (native and broken) English since they were simultaneously filming for an episode of Bizarre Foods. One of the bears in Kuusamo, called Juuso, weighed 483 kg back in 2011, but the bear in the gif looks like it might be even bigger.\nRussian petting zoo.\nIn Soviet Russia bear \"pet\" you.\nRussian heavy petting zoo... \nundefined\nundefined\nI'm happy that bear has someone to take care of him and be his friend, but I couldn't do what that guy is doing.  I got a hole in my hand as a kid from a freaking pet parrot and a scar from a Basset Hound, I can only imagine what that bear would do.\nFor real though my basset hound is the most unintentionally destructive thing I've ever met.\nParrots are intentionally destructive.\n\nAll the sexual jealousy of an abusive spouse, packed into a tiny form with a vicious beak.\nundefined\nundefined\nThat is the biggest fucking bear I have ever seen.\nAnd that Grizzly is pretty big too...\nJeffery Dean Morgan really gained some weight...\nGlad I wasn't the only one thinking that.\nundefined\nTrinket? Vex will be jealous..\nundefined\nTwo bears having a roll in the hay.\nRobert Baratheon faked his death so he could run into the woods and play with bears.\nundefined\nI see two bears here ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nundefined\nI didn't see anyone post it, so here's the source:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4E9yrGczbk\nEvery time I see gifs, television shows, youtube clips, like this, it makes me wonder how far along we are to actually domesticating animals like the Brown Bear.\n\nLike, surely, there had to be a point in history where some guy was like \"See, honey, this Wolf thing is actually pretty cool! We feed it table scraps give it a warm place to hang out at night, and it watches the yard and murders interlopers. We're all set!\"\n\nThen it conveniently forgets the domestication part and eats the shit out of their child.\n\nThis is kind of where we are with brown bears right now. Couple people the world over appear to have a pretty good grip on, if not domestication but *training*, and every so often, something goes awry and the [bear-tamer gets eaten by the bear.](http://www.today.com/id/24266564/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/bear-trainer-distraught-after-deadly-attack/)\n\nEvery time I see something like that, I wonder to myself... \"How far am I from driving to Petsmart and finding an aisle of Bear Bits and Koala Kibble?\"\nundefined\nundefined\n",

I've had to wear long sleeves for the past week because it looks like I self-harm after my cat kicked off my wrist.\n\nEdit: It's not like my cats try to hurt me. They're extremely gentle when I play with them, won't bite or scratch. It's that I'll carry them around and inevitably my girlfriend will drop a pan or the TV will play a scary sound and he'll launch off me and run for the nearest hiding hole.\nAll cats have different temperaments, but it's also important to socialize cats as kittens. That's when they learn how hard to bite and whether or not to scratch. My cat will be very displeased when I carry her, but she's never bitten me hard or scratched me.\nRight right. Both of my cats are great about that. My male cat will go so far as so make sure not to use his claws when he walks on you or jumps in your lap. \n\nHowever, he also gets confused if he can't see (i.e. he's under a blanket) and will scratch by accident. But you should see his pathetic face when he realizes he's scratched a person. He even mopes for a while. \n&gt; However, he also gets confused if he can't see (i.e. he's under a blanket) and will scratch by accident. But you should see his pathetic face when he realizes he's scratched a person. He even mopes for a while.\n\nMy cats do this 100%.  Also - if I rub the belly with my hand they put up with it.  If I use my foot, it's 100% kill mode until I yelp in pain.\nI mean. Let's be honest. Would you like it if I rubbed your belly with my foot? \n\nI know I wouldn't like it. \nWhy wouldn't you like rubbing my belly with your foot? \nWell, do you have athlete's tummy? That might be a reason. \nI heard pro slip and sliders get that all the time.\n;)\nundefined\nMy cats do this too. Why are cats so offended when you use your foot to pet them?\nBecause feet are fucking gross.\nundefined\nMine is actually fine with it\n\nShe initially would attack my feet when shed be laying beside them. But other time I've expertly petted her without being scratched and now she's pretty chill about it.\n\nShe still likes to play though and depending on mood will attack feet.\n\nWhen we got her she hated being picked up. I did the pet thing. I would pick her up and pet her into submission. Sometimes it went well others not. But if I did it right, she's got his spot under her cheeks that makes her a purring cuddle machine. You hit that there is no more struggle, at least until she realises what just happened.\nundefined\nHeh, my cat is the opposite.  She loves foot rubs but vocally objects when I try to use my hand.\nundefined\nMy cat once bit me (my fault, completely) and he was more offended than I was.  It was kind of funny to see how upset he was.\nundefined\nI had a Maine Coon and he was the same way, but he'd get very pissed if I carried him for a long time. Or if he was outside and refused to come in (he was indoor/outdoor). Also bathtime HOLY SHIT\n\nLol other cats have bitten me in recent time, I swear nothing compares to my old Maine Coon. He was a big boy. Lived to 15. Greatest pet I've ever had and undoubtedly made me a cat person. \n\nI mean dogs are fucking great too but I'm pretty sure since he was raised around dogs, he behaved like them. He would drink from the toilet. He also slept with me almost every night. It's been 3 years and dammit do I still miss him. \nIt's been 3 years since I lost my Maine coon too. He wasn't raised around dogs, but he certainly had the personality of one. I have two other cats now (one I had when he was still with me) and I still miss that beautiful guy all the time. He was just such an awesome kitty. \nundefined\nundefined\nYeah, we have one cat who likes to play rough but never uses her claws or bites hard enough to hurt, and another cat who just doesn't get it and you can only really play with him with toys. We got them both when they were around 6 months old, so we didn't have a chance to socialize them ourselves.\nGenerally they're nice. They know not to bite and scratch, even when playing.\n\nBut if you're holding a cat and talking to your girlfriend doing dishes and she drops a pan on the floor, I think most people are going to get mauled regardless.\nnot entirely.  one cat we got a as a 1yr old, he enjoyes being carried and hugged and petted.  The other one we got as a 8 week old. She will NOT be fussed over. and she will hurt you if you pick her up\nwhen I pick up my cat he turns into a sack\nYou put things in him and use him to carry them around you sick bastard?\nundefined\nIf you get a raggdoll they literally do nothing as you carry them.\nRaggdolls are awesome cats. The only place I've seen them is in pet stores at the mall close to where I live, and I try really hard not to support this places. They are great docile cats though. \nundefined\nundefined\n[deleted]\nI think it's largely their personality and breed. I've raised my cats the same way and one was a typical aloof asshole cat, one is extremely shy, one was a dog trapped in a cats body, and the other is a I love only one person and the rest of you I'm gonna rip to shreds kind of cat. \nI don't have cats but seen enough of those videos where a kitten climbs the person getting the bowl ready... carrying the cub might be the lesser of two evils, lol. That or it can't figure out stairs.\nYou need to upgrade from cloth armor to chain mail or plate\nBig cats learn how to use their knives quicker than domestic cats. The reason is that they can easily injure or kill with their strength and claws, so they learn out of necessity.\nundefined\nGIVE ME THE NOMS!\nFucking Simba....\nhe literally can't even\nGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMME\nundefined\nTwo of them are not like the others\ndog lion and white lion\nSnoop lion \nSoon he'll be Snoop Laser Snake. \n&gt; Snoop Solid Snake\n\nFTFY\nSolid Snoop.\nI think I took one of those this morning after coffee.\nMetal Gear Snoop\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nSnoop Lion, you say?\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Y93Co8B.jpg)\n...

Especially their artists.\nOne of my music theory professors once said, \"the greatest trick ever pulled by Austria was convincing the world that Beethoven was Austrian and Hitler was German.\"\nTIL people think Beethoven was Austrian\nYeah, sounds like bollocks.

Why would he kick that poor cat like that? Even if he doesn't like the owner he should understand that you never treat an innocent animal this way. I wish this video had more popularity. \nundefined\n[From someone above](https://projecticarus2015.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/a-rescuer-is-supposed-to-rescue/)    \nundefined\nSee all the cubs? They can'tall be rescues which means breeding, you don't breed at a sanctuary, you sterilize. \n\nIt's unfortunate we find it cute. Also too much human interaction. Shouldn't be in a house. The theory is to keep it a natural almost wild environment.   \nundefined\n\"Be cool Frank, be cool\"\n\n\"Remember, roar not bark\"\nhttp://imgur.com/a/JAM04\nSo, I love big cats as much as the next guy, but... what's the story here?  That is a LOT of cubs, like the number you'd expect someone who is breeding them for personal gain would have.  These big cat \"rescues\" seem less like rescues, and more like a way to word your business instead of \"Get your farm fresh exotic pets here!\"\n[I posted this already but I'll leave it here, too.](https://projecticarus2015.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/a-rescuer-is-supposed-to-rescue/) He buys them off of people and puts them in a slightly bigger caged area and calls it rehabilitation. I'm very curious what he's going to do when he has fifty adult big cats running around since it's the cubs that get him all the attention on Facebook.\n\nHe's also against neutering the males and/or putting the females on birth control so guess what's going to happen when all those animals decide to breed? \nUgh. That was a depressing article. It sounds like he is a glorified animal hoarder. \nI really feel like he has good intentions but there's responsible rehabilitation and then being a hoarder who thinks love and close human contact is going to be what's best for the animals in the long run.\n\nI used to think he spent his money buying the cubs from private owners and kept them until he found bigger sanctuaries to take them but it's obvious he's trying to make his own with zero experience. The fact that he said he's against contraceptives but won't spay and neuter because it's not the natural~ way of life is hilarious considering he raises them in a human house with the couch as a chew toy and then sticks them in a pen that's equivalent to housing a dog in a travel kennel.\n&gt; a hoarder who thinks love and close human contact is going to be what's best for the animals in the long run.\n\nThose are the ones whose remains are eventually found in the cage.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nwow those videos were physically sickening. \nIt's why I'm wasting time out of my day to comment here. No ethical rescuer would let a paralyzed animal writhe around the floor for weeks on end (using it for Instagram followers) and then put it through a painful surgery just to see if it would do better.\nI follow big cat rescue on facebook and all of the people from BJWT attacking them has been overwhelming lately. it's frustratingly ridiculous but i also try to post what a shit place BJWT is when i see it, gonna be adding this to the arsenal. i can't believe that poor cub is ON THE FLOOR. \nIsn't that hilarious? He has so many idiots jumping on his bandwagon who don't stop and go, \"Wait, why are we shitting on a legit organization helping rescue these animals?\"\n\nI love how his \"volunteers\" are hot girls in trendy outfits who I assume don't have a veterinary degree or aren't up for shoveling a ton of shit and feeding them hundreds of pounds of raw smelly meat every day.\nundefined\nHere's another good link: http://911animalabuse.com/black-jaguar-white-tiger/\n&gt; He's also against neutering the males and/or putting the females on birth control so guess what's going to happen when all those animals decide to breed?\n\nLet's hope he at least made them reliant on lysine...\nSounds like [Big Cat Rescue](http://bigcatrescue.org/) is gonna need some more enclosures. \nJudging by his rants attacking other rescue organizations who have tried to forge a relationship with him, he'd probably be more likely to give away the cats to his friends than other sanctuaries.\nundefined\nundefined\nYou should check out Big Cat Rescue. They're a non-profit rehabilitation and rescue center down in the US. They rehab local wildlife where they can and try to improve the quality of life for non-native species like tigers and lions. They take the traditional hands-off approach, which I like a lot, but they try to keep the animals mentally and physically active as much as they're able to.\n\nThis guy OP posted from; not so much. I'm skeptical the moment I see a big cat as a house pet.\n\nEDIT: Fixing a typo.\nYou talking about [Turpentine Creek Wildlife Refuge](http://www.turpentinecreek.org/)? \n\nFantastic organization about 30 minutes from my home. And for all you Tyson Foods haters, they feed the animals with truckloads of 100% donated frozen chicken. \nSo for comparison, Turpentine Creek's wiki states they have 130 animals on 459 acres. BJWT has over 200 cats (last number I've been able to find but everyone knows he doesn't release transparent records) on 100 acres (which also hasn't been proven because he answers questions like this with promises of acquiring over 3000 acres out of his ass somehow).\n\n\nundefined\nundefined\nIt could be similar to this\n\n[The Illegal Big Cats of Instagram - Vice\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Euo3JaqFoss)\nThis is from the owner of Black Jaguar-White Tiger. There's been some controversy over his methods but he does seem to really care for the animals at his rescue. He has saved a lot from circuses and personal owners.\n\nEDIT. Ok, I get it, he's an asshole.\nWhat's that expression?   The road to hell is paved with good intentions.  \n\nI don't doubt he cares for these animals.   That doesn't mean the environment is right for them.  Lions aren't meant to be living en masses in some rich guys house.  He's going to get overwhelmed once they start breeding or worse, killed in an attack.  Which would probably lead to the animal(s) being put down.  \nIncluding two Savannahs that he 'saved' from an owner who absolutely adored them and is currently fighting tooth and nail to get her pets back.  Pets that she _paid_ to have sent to him so that he could house them in what he claimed would be a 22 acre enclosure.  Instead there's a video of him kicking one of them and telling the woman to 'come and get her cats'.\n&gt; video of him kicking one of them\n\nJesus, got a link for that? \n[He either kicks or shoves it to the ground at the beginning of the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=11&amp;v=dFvs-k7wC58) Not really that bad and the rant is way more indicative of his unprofessionalism and nutcase status. \n\nTagging /u/KimchiTacos_ since you asked for a link, too.\nhttps://youtu.be/dFvs-k7wC58\nundefined\nundefined\nAnd how are his conditions better than these other \"personal owners\"? The cages are overcrowded once they become adults and are moved over to that area after he's gotten all his cute photos and videos out of them. \nThey're not. I'm specializing in African wildlife rehabilitation and have worked at a credible santuary, and his videos make me want to cry. He has so many issues I never even know where to start. One of my biggest problems are that he \"rescues\" a lot of his cubs by buying them, therefore directly funding the wildlife black market.\nBut it's so cute how five giant cats can play together! Never mind denying them a pride and ability to establish their own territory instead of packing them all into one acre! LOOK HOW CUTE IT IS!\nMost regular pet rescues are like that as well if you dig deep enough. I'm not talking about legit brick and mortar county shelters, and of course not all rescues are bad, but many of them are either fronts for animal hoarders to get around pet limits in most cities, or they are people who take advantages of discounted vet care, volunteers, donations, tax breaks, and feel-good publicity to run profitable second-hand pet stores. Not like \"get rich\" profit but enough that it means not having to work. They frequently push \"only rescues are qualified to care for puppies\" because puppies are the most adoptable, which means they are sold - sorry, adopted - quickest and thus are the most profitable. It's not a coincidence that so many rescues are full when you call them about older or injured dogs, because those eat more into the bottom line by being less adoptable.\n\nA lot of rescues are just people working out of their own backyard. Instead of breeding them themselves (which is very expensive when done properly), they just trawl Facebook groups and craigslist for free/found kittens and puppies to refill their \"inventory\". I just read the other day that one rescue (a one-person operation from her backyard of course) was brought a small dog that actually belonged to the finder's neighbor. The rescue sold the dog that same day and when the actual owner found her, she refused to say who bought the dog because she didn't want to give the money back. \n\nIt's really disgusting when you start taking it all apart. I don't blame the volunteers or the good rescues, but the bad ones get free passes so frequently it's disgusting. \nundefined\nThe indignity on the face of the cub being carried is too much. \nAll I saw was a cub that desperately wanted the food in the bowl next to it!\nRight, a cub who couldn't get the food it desperately wanted because it was being carried, hence the indignity.\nundefined\nWhat's with non-zoo people owning exotic cats lately ?\n\nWhich countries allow this dumb shit ?\n\nThis is in Mexico, and it's supposedly a big cat rescue.  In reality it's run by a man who acts like a petulant child, doesn't understand how to handle big cats, and treats it as a way to get internet famous and attract celebrities.\nBasically PETA Trump.\ncult of bjwt \nundefined\nSadly, a lot of them. There are currently more tigers in private captivity in the state of Texas alone than exist in the wild. The organization that is the source of the gif is just a glorified backyard zoo. \nthe other problem too is that they're not even really preserving suitable genetics.\n\nThey're just inbreeding big cats like a whitetrash lady breeding shihtzus for sale\nThe United States of America. It varies by state, but there are more tigers in captivity in the USA than there are in the wild. By a lot. I don't wanna think about how many lions there are.\nI looked this up not too long ago, IIRC its around 5,000 tigers in the wild and over 20,000 in captivity world wide. Around 8,000 of those captive tigers are in the USA. Most owned by private owners and private zoos.\nThanks for looking that up. Damn that's depressing.\nundefined\nI definitely saw a few dogs.  \nBut what is the white beast in the end?  \nLooks more like a wolf or polar bear then a cat.  \nWhite lions.\nVision dreams of passion.\nBlowin through my mind\nAnd all the while I think of you\nwhite, liiiiiiiiiiiiions\nDON'T DO IT\nundefined\nWait. Wait.\nundefined\nI bet I can pick out the problem child\nYeah, the asshole keeping all of these cubs in such unnatural conditions.\nthat one bowl isn't enough for all of them \nIt will be for the victor.\nundefined\noh i think you missed the two dogs. they should be enough for them\n10 lions enter.  1 lion eats.\nSome of those were doggies though \nDessert.\nIf I was rich, i'd probably have too many lions\nI can only afford secondhand lions.\nGod, that's a great movie.\nWhat movie?\nSecondhand Lions\nhttp://imdb.com/rg/an_share/title/title/tt0327137/\nundefined\nThat\nDad, stop using Reddit\nundefined\nWent out with their boots on!\nundefined\none lion is too many already.\nYou can never have too many lions. You could even trade some for Finland's military...[if you find someone to take them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1pcO-qcZg)\nundefined\nundefined\nThe Black Jaguar White Tiger is so fucking weird. Like yeah, it's great that he takes care of these animals that have been treated poorly, but then he goes on these psycho rants and tries to to take down other orgs through his instagram and makes pleas to Apple and Tim Cook to make him an Apple \"reprensentative\" or something? I have no clue what's up with him. He seems like an attention-seeking drama queen.\n&gt;He seems like an attention-seeking drama queen\n\nDing ding ding.  We have a winner.  He's a terrible person who claims to be attempting to do good work while whoring out his cats - which he purchases from breeders, only perpetuating the problem - for Internet fame and being able to consort with celebrities.\nCheck this link out, drama queen doesn't even scratch the surface: http://911animalabuse.com/black-jaguar-white-tiger/\nTalking about having a little pride\nAnyone else see how much easier it was for the dogs to climb the stairs compared to the lions?\n[removed]\nThis guy is a rich dude who buys from exotic animal dealers and drops a huge number of animals into an environment that is not a rescue environment.

I can also confirm as I have a stray that I saved and lives in my front yard. She disappears for entire days and comes back meowing her ass off for hugs and food like it never happened \nMy friend in high school used to have a cat that would basically come back to his house to get stitched up after it got in fights. It would eat, get healed up for a few days, and leave for weeks at a time again, only to come back again after it got all fucked up in a fight.\nSounds like my dad\nDo we have the same father? \nWe do meow?\nAll nimbly bimbly?\nDo you see me drinking milk from a saucer?\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nSounds like my grandma.\nundefined\nundefined\nHa, your friend was an NPC for that cat's quest.\nKhajiit has wares if you have heals.\nundefined\nWelcome home, good hunter.\nundefined\n/r/outside\nundefined\nundefined\nI had a cat like this when i was younger, we would see him in different neighborhood with other cats and he always looked like he was afraid we'd blow is cover. His name was Wiley.  He would disappear for weeks and then come home with random wounds. One time he came back and was missing half an ear :(.  Another time we dug a BB out of his head. He would eat so much and then sleep for days, like he was recovering. Once the healing process was done he would disappear again. After 13 years of this, he left one day and never came back. RIP\nHe probably just found a nice lady cat and settled down. :)\nOn a farm upstate, right?\nThe farm is six hours away, so that's why we never visit\nMy cat actually had this happen. She was nine when my dad wanted to get rid of her. She was stir crazy as an indoor cat where we had moved. Instead of a farm, it was a rather remote diesel truck repair shop. My grandfather knew the guy that ran it, and my cat lived out the rest of her days keeping the place mouse free.\n\nAnd unlike most other stories like this, I got proof when I visited some time later... but only once. It was the last time I ever saw her, but she lived to at least 10 years which is a pretty good run. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nMy friend had a similar cat. Butthead was huge and was missing pieces of ears, was armored with scar tissue, and was one of the most friendly cats I've known.\nWiley had the personality of a dog, only cat ive ever met like that.\nundefined\nundefined\nAww, they're like Matt Murdock and Claire Temple!\nundefined\nundefined\nThat BBC study right? It was pretty neat. They form little kitty grids that they regularly patrol, and if there's another cat in the way they'll usually automagically adjust their patrols and avoid each other. So a cat rich neighborhood will have near perfect cat blocks all mapped out. \n\nHmm, that may be good for search and rescue...\n&gt; automagically \n\nLearned a new word today.  Thank you.\nundefined\nundefined\nsame here. I'm not a cat guy, she just chose me. We're watching Netflix sometimes\nMy parents were chosen by a cat 9 years ago. Actually it chose the dog it just would follow them on walks. Eventually my dad started leaving a bowl of catfood for it in the garage (we had a doggy door it would use) but yea cat has cooexisted with my parents for a long while even sleeping in thier bed sometimes; but she'll still  disappear for up to a week at a time. It's name as far as my parents are concerned is still just \"Kitty\". When my parents would go on cruises I'd take care of the dog for a week. I'd ask \"should i take the cat too?\" My parents would just say \"nah she'll go do cat things for a couple weeks, the dog is the only one  too dumb to survive without us\" \nmy next door neighbors growing up had a cat they called \"gray kitty\".  They only had the one so IDK why they had to specify gray.  \nMy family had a a dog with the name \"Brown dog\".\nundefined\nOur previous vagabond kitty was a large silver tabby called cat. The current one is a little black male called small cat. Maybe they had another one previously.\nundefined\nundefined\nMy cat chose me. People think its a nonsensical thing to say but it really does happen. \n\nI was at a pet store where they had a wall of cages with shelter pets for adoption and this little black kitten was in one of them all by herself and she wouldn't come to play with any of the people in front of me or even look at them. \n\nI approached and she looked at me, but still didn't come forward. I went to move to the next cage to look at the other kittens and a little paw came out and snagged my shirt, and I looked back and she was right there staring at me and purring. \n\nI took her home that instant. \nFollow up please!\nHow did she turn out as a pet?\nShe's absolutely adorable and loves to cuddle and snuggle but she's still very mischievous. She greets me at the door each day when I come home from work and will block me from going places until I pick her up and hold her for a minute. \nThat's amazing. My cat just judges me from afar. Constantly. \nundefined\nSounds like my husband's cat. I held her in the shelter but she wiggled until I gave her to him. Now when we come home, she yells until he goes and gives her cuddles. You can hear her from across the house lol\nundefined\nSounds legit. In my experience, cats seem to gel with people who don't pay them too much attention on first sight.\nMy cat is still this way. When someone comes over, if they ignore her she comes up to them. If they try and pet her she runs away. \nIt also means no kitten will ever like me because I can't help picking them up and petting them until they get away from me in disgust.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nThis sounds a little too much like me and my wife's story..\nundefined\nNetflix and purr, huh?\nundefined\nThere was another study that used bodycams that discovered the same thing. It also found that cats are vicious killing machines, and love tight spaces. If your cat disappears it probably found a tight space somewhere, got stuck and died from exposure/thirst.\nMy coworker had a cat that they thought ran away. Every day he'd come into work exhausted because his daughter was up all night crying about the cat.\n\nSoon he stopped telling crying daughter stories and started telling stories about the weird smell in his kitchen. Eventually it got real bad and they tracked it to the dead cat stuck behind the fridge.\nBut was it their cat?\nundefined\nDid the cat never meow? This is kinda hard to believe unless the cat was some sort of mute.\nDepends when it died, it might have even gone there to die. It's unlikely it starved to death though if it didn't make a racket. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\n... I had a cat \"run off\" once. \n\nFound out years later, my dad didn't want me to be mad at him because it slept in his car and he killed it once. He only admitted it to me cause we were both drunk and apparently, it was bothering him that I never knew what happened. Also, he thinks another cat of mine got eaten by big owls? He says he saw three \"very large birds\" in the woods nearby, and the next day the cat was gone. I've gotten lots of confessions out of him by visiting home and getting drunk with him.\nWell thank God he only killed it once \nIt does present a mystery though, shouldn't he have killed it nine times?\nundefined\nundefined\nIn the 7 years I was working as an automotive technician, there were about three instances of cats. One lady had lost her cat a few days prior to coming in to have her vehicle serviced. Symptoms were loud screeching sound. Turned out the cat had found its way inside the engine bay and when she started the car, the car got caught up in the serpentine belt and got its neck snapped and broke the tensioner pulley. One was a meowing noise under the dash. Somehow a kitten got into the car and made its way up inside the dash. About $600 later, the owner of the car was awarded a healthy little kitten. Expensive cat in my opinion. And the last one was a cat that had gotten hit on the highway and damaged the radiator. Obviously the cat was no more. \nThe one with the serpentine belt... did you tell the lady it was the cat, or shelter her?\nYou can always compromise and say it was a squirrel \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nSadly they don't usually \"run off\" if they have a place they're getting regular food.  Cats are very territorial and won't willingly leave their territory, as they get lost easily outside it.  \nMy ex cheated on me so much, that I started interpreting your sentence as,\n\n\"They're doing more than just 'going for a run', if one of your neighbors is regularly feeding them\"\n\nBut I got halfway through and realized that's not the context or the direction you were taking.\nThat's why you shouldn't date a cat, I guess. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nThat's how we got our cat back when I was in grade school.  Rode in a tire well for about a half hour on our neighbor's car.  Hopped out when the guy got home and sprinted over to our door at 6 months old meowing like crazy.\n\nHe's a golden long hair old man now named Midas.\n&gt; He's a golden long hair old man now named Midas.\n\nI'm confused? Who's the \"*golden long hair old man*\"? Your cat or the neighbor?\nthe car\nundefined\nundefined\nThat is what it looked like for me. It was sleeping somewhere in the car undercarriage \nundefined\nundefined\nI was driving on the freeway in southern California when the driver in front of me threw about 7 kittens out of the window. It was too late to stop for the kittens so I tried to get the guys license plate but he sped off. It was one of the most depressing things I've ever seen. So it does happen. It's scary to think that there are people out there who have no problem throwing cute little innocent kittens out the window for fun.\nI was driving home from a job interview and the car ahead of me pulled over, opened the door, pushed a dog out, and drove off. One of the busiest streets in town and the dog just sat there staring at the car as it was driving off. He started just howling and it was the most heartbreaking sound ever. I stopped and got out and sat near him (I did get the plate number btw) he came right over and basically collapsed in my lap. He was destroyed. I took him home not intending to keep him at all but here we are a few months later and he's my heart dog. I found the original owners and the guy said \"just f*ckin keep him\" how messed up is that?? This dog is rad AF! Smart, calm, loves EVERYONE and everything! And handsome to top it all off... That guy really doesn't know what he missed out on. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/52y9bd/hammock_cuddles_and_puppy_kisses/?st=1Z141Z3&amp;sh=08ed60fc\nGood on you, not only for stopping and helping the dog out but being willing to treat it how it should be even if you weren't planning to.\nHe is the coolest. Couldn't have asked for a better dog to be dropped in my life. \nI didn't find out until after I'd had her for a while that my dog Maeby had been given up by two or three homes before she landed with me. She was the sweetest dog and was pretty well-behaved. No idea how anyone could have given her up.\nI have a similar situation. The dog is incredible, she is so smart and gorgeous to boot. Looks almost identical to a \"Dutch Shepherd\", to the point where someone who trains dogs for K9 duties for the local police actually insisted that she was a dutchie. In reality she's a mutt from a local reserve.\n\nI still don't understand how people didn't want her. Well behaved, calm, sweet. Thing is though, I think that because she was passed around different places (she lived with her foster mom, then a failed adoption of a couple of months, then foster mom again, then another failed adoption for a couple of months) she had major separation anxiety. She used to sit in front of the door and howl and scratch at the door when we left. We tried to crate her, but she just howled in the crate and moved it around so much so, that she managed to bring it close to a dresser and scratched it up. \n\nSo my girlfriend and I started looking into training, and how to deal with it and after one particularly long week full of training which included grabbing keys, then putting them back down, putting shoes on and taking them off repeatedly, opening the door and closing it without going anywhere, we had a massive breakthrough, and now she is perfect when left at home. Completely quiet and calm. \n\nThree years later and my girlfriend is a fairly successful dog trainer, and my sweet girl is almost titled in obedience.\n\nFrom what I heard from the foster mom, the separation anxiety was never an issue until she got to us. Which I think was caused by her being abandoned by so many people. I found that weird, because I assumed that was why the other homes couldn't handle her. Other than that, she was honestly amazing, and once we figured out how to desensitize her to us leaving and comforted her by always coming back, we have no issues.\n\nI am glad that yours worked out for you as well.\n\nCheers,\n\ninfestahDeck\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nSounds like the dog is MUCH better off with you than it would have been with that guy even if he hadn't abandoned it.  What a piece of shit.\nundefined\nDear person, you- like your dog- are rad AF. \n\nMy best wishes to you guys! Hope you both are great! And I'm glad to know that another dog in the world has a loving home. \nundefined\nundefined\nI just don't fucking understand this.  Every god damn city has some fucking animal shelter somewhere that will take your kittens off of your hands free of charge.  Not only that, they will feed them, give them shelter, and find real homes for them.  \n\nWHY on earth would someone just throw them out of a moving car as opposed to just dropping them off at an animal shelter?  I mean Jesus Christ.  \nIt's because some people are just plain wrong in the head. I remember reading (citation needed) that animal cruelty is one of the early signs of physical abuse and murder. Basically, if you're doing this kind of thing your much more likely to go on and do it to humans. I think that fact reveals the kind of person who does this thing.\nundefined\nWhere I used to live, the only shelters around would put the kittens to sleep when they got them due to already having too many cats. Needless to say, when my cat got pregnant, I kept the kittens and cared for them myself until we could find good homes for them. \nI would argue that a peaceful death with blue juice is better than being tossed out the window on a freeway. \nI agree. When I was growing up we had a few cats get pregnant and give birth in the same week. There was no way we could afford to get them all fixed. While we were figuring out what to do with them, a neighbor decided to leave out cans of fancy feast spiked with rat poison. I was about 13 at the time and found kittens in the alley, foaming at the mouth, dieing. That's when my mom made the hard decision to take all but 1 (I was allowed to keep 1) to a shelter where they were put down (she couldn't find a no kill shelter). \n\nSadly, it was the better option for them, as much as it pains me. \nundefined\nundefined\nAround here our local shelter will put the kittens up for adoption and make space by releasing the least adoptable cats after they've been spayed/neutered. Kittens have the best chance of being adopted so it makes no sense to euthanize them.\nundefined\nWe went through this a little under a year ago. A stray came to our front door and all but let herself in our house. Turned out she was about to burst with the babies. Got them all homes including the mom.\nundefined\nStill beats being thrown out of a moving car.\nundefined\nundefined\nYeah. Always when I hear of these things, I realize that there are far more people like this than would admit. It's literally making me \"lose faith in humanity\".\n\nBut it is nothing more than realization now. You don't want to believe it, but it just is like this.\nOne of the things I realized when I became an adult is that humans as a whole think far too highly of ourselves.  We are more animal than we admit.\nundefined\nundefined\nFuck dude. That story sucks :/  \n\nI know this stuff definitely happens but why? Shelters take animals for free without questioning. Why dump them somewhere like that. \nOut of a moving truck? Because you're a psychopath. \nI mean, even if some lard ass didn't want to go to or didn't know about places taking them for free, out of a moving truck is obviously sadistic in nature. \nundefined\nundefined\nNo. It fell off the car: http://i.imgur.com/a2RD06Q.gif\nundefined\nWe know the position, so we can't know the momentum.\nundefined\nundefined\nI picked a kitten up out of a grassy median of a busy road during rush hour. It was about 8 years ago when I was working a crap job to pay off student loans. The guy I was working with was driving and saw the kitten when we were stopped at a red light. He pointed it out to me. Then when the light turned green and we started driving I realized the little thing was probably going to end up as roadkill if we left it, so I had him turn around. Hopped out at one red light, grabbed the kitten, and hopped back in at the next red light. Still have the fuzzy guy to this day!\n\nEDIT: I did not pay the cat tax and it was a terrible crime. Here he is, all grown up. http://imgur.com/a/apFGJ\nNice to hear that you and your coworker still have good working relations so many years later!\n[Ah, the ol' Reddit rescue-a-roo](https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplaygirls/comments/52ufob/misty_cosplay_by_kay_bear_self/d7nsyjw?context=2)\nHold my tail, I'm going in!\nI missed these.\n\nIt seemed like reddit collectively decided it wouldn't be a thing for a month or two, or maybe I just wasn't seeing them.\n\nEither way, absence makes the heart grow fonder.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nAny chance we can see the cat? \nundefined\nThe lack of picture of your friend at the end of this comment is distressing.\nundefined\nThis was painful to watch but I'm so glad it ended well\nVery much a \"No no no nooo no NOOOO NOOO ah, yesssss.\"\n[/r/nonononoyes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nonononoyes/)\n/r/nonononoaww\nundefined\n/r/sweatypalms material too\n/r/KneesWeakArmsAreHeavy\nThere's /r/VomitOnHisSweaterAlready\n/r/momsspaghetti \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nNo yes my asshole is still puckering that poor baby. \nwell maybe stop shoving kittens up your ass\nD:\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nI hope it didn't get it's leg ran over.

At least they all had the decency to steer around it. Glad (s)he got a warm human to pick him/her up and hopefully give a loving home.\nI know! I think the kitten fell from the first truck, like it was hiding up in the wheel well or engine compartment. Can you imagine the tiny, pitiful *meows* as it sat hunched on the road? Oof! \n\n\nWow I'm a dog guy but reading these comments it is quite clear y'all love cats a lot and that makes me happy even if I don't understand it \nIf everyone took this approach to everything world peace would be achieved overnight\nundefined\nI started out as a dog person, but then I moved in with someone who had cats. It's a whole other set of instincts to contend with, but all the affection, intelligence, and entertaining antics are still there. Now I'm a dog and cat person.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nI thought so as well. my heart was sinking. it ended well but it's horrifying. the poor cat.\nYou at least know he was going to get rescued from the title, imagine the first person watching the video though\nundefined\nundefined\nHonestly, as glad as I am that he was able to save the cat... he's lucky he didn't cause a ten car pileup and get himself &amp; someone else killed by stopping in the middle of a highway like that. This is an insanely dangerous thing to do.\n\nOn the other hand, one could argue that it's just as likely that someone would have eventually swerved to avoid that car and caused a pileup that way. \n\nI really don't know how to feel. Glad it worked out and the kitten is safe. Poor thing.\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/montreal/emma-czornobaj-gets-90-days-in-jail-for-duck-stopping-deaths-1.2877437\n\nA Quebec Superior Court judge sentenced Emma Czornobaj to 90 days in jail today for causing two deaths after stopping on the highway to rescue ducklings.\n\nEdit 2: fixed link.  Thanks, jfong86!\n\nEdit:. Just to be clear, I am not agreeing or disagreeing with that judgement in this post... I just thought it might be relevant here.\nHoly shit.\n\nImagine having that on your record, having to tick \"yes\" on job applications when they ask if you're ever been convicted. At least they usually have a few lines underneath so you can explain.\nThe check mark alone is almost always an automatic \"toss this application\" unless they're really desperate unfortunately.\n*ticks box*\n\n*pulls out big black marker*\n\n**DUCKLINGS** \n*Gets filed under \"Bestiality applications\"*\n\n(and yes, I get the irony) \nnah, you write **SAVED DUCKLINGS, GOT SENT TO JAIL**. If I were an employer, I would call that person in for an interview, just so that i can get the full story.\nYes, most employers would do that. The problem is when you tick yes the system automatically sorts you out of the process before a human ever sees it.\nIt's wonderful. We have a system where you serve time to get rehabilitated, then they still punish you for the remainder of your life even after you do your time. \nundefined\nDepends on the job. My place of work relies heavily on federal, state, and county background checks. But certain crimes are irrelevant and dont affect your chance at the job. We dont even run the background check until after the interview.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nBeing a felon my entire adult life. I've learn to check the no box anyways. I've never once gotten a job after checking that box yes, and even been told a few times they automatically toss it. Sure if they find out you actually are convicted you lose the job, but you never get it in the first place if you do, and I'll take the couple months of work before it happens (only been called out on it twice in my over 30 jobs)\n&gt; (only been called out on it twice in my over 30 jobs)\n\nHoly crap, &gt;30 jobs?  Assuming you are in the middle of your career, that is a new job roughly every 8 months.  If you don't mind me asking, what is your career field that requires that kind of turnover?\nCould be some kind of contractor; painter, roofer, construction laborer, etc. Something where those kind of jobs come and go unless you're on a good company or in a union. \n\nCould also just be a shitty employee.. we will not know.\nsome people don't like staying in a single place for very long\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nwell all the footage is sped up for a chunk of the time so it's a bit misleading. It looks like he came to a gradual stop rather than just stomping on the brakes like some people have a tendency to do. \nundefined\nThe video looked pretty sped up. Don't think they were going all that quick, if they were that cat would of landed much worse...\n\n&gt; On the other hand, one could argue that it's just as likely that someone would have eventually swerved to avoid that car and caused a pileup that way.\n\nSo... basically the most resonsible thing would have been to go ahead and just run over that kitten.\nMy first training day of driving a school bus I had to mow down a whole family of ducks on the highway. I was specifically told not to serve or stop because it causes accidents. It's even more important in a bus because a sharp swerve can flip a bus.  \n\nOn a related note,  if someone pulls out in front of me,  I can't swerve either,  so they'd better hope they left enough room for me to stop.  It takes about 260ft to stop when traveling 50mph and even more when the bus is loaded with people. I'll rear end a vehicle before ever swerving and possibly flipping a bus full of kids with no seat belts.  I wish more people knew this because I get cut off in traffic quite often. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nthe video cuts out before the guy is rear-ended by a semi and his car bursts into flames\nThis kills the cat\nPlot twist: he was taking a photo of the kitten on his Galaxy Note 7.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nKitten cashing in some of his extra lives early.\nIt still has 5 left \nYou're counting by the cars that drove over him plus when he dropped out right?\nundefined\nundefined\nI tried to count the number of \"lives\" (aka cars).

I can't imagine how someone could be this ignorant, how do you seriously get to this point?\nAlso, the driving skills of the black car that hit him are appalling. He successfully managed to swerve out in a free lane, all he had to do then was to not panic and grab the brakes, causing him to spin back into the middle lane.\n\nHigh speed lane-change, and emergency braking should be mandatory at the driving exam, just like it is for motorcycles.\nundefined\nThat guy had to make some (very) stupid decisions there, but, Devil's advocate here:\n\nIf that car was rear wheel drive, had a normal differential instead of a limited slip differential, and had one of its rear tires blowout like it looks like it did: \n\nHe probably came to a stop because he blew the tire out and panicked (Slamming on the brakes, rather than letting it coast and getting over to the side of the road: stupid decision one), then once he was stopped he tried to give it a little gas to get to the side of the road and found it wouldn't move (because the differential was sending all the power to the wheel with no traction), and then (rather than pushing the car out of the way, or calling a tow truck: stupid decision two) thought it would be better to fix the problem as quickly as possible.\n\nTwo errors leading to a massive clusterfuck of stupid.\n\nOf course, the car that hit him obviously wasn't paying attention, and didn't know how to handle a momentary loss of traction, so stupidity there, too. \n\nDriver of the car with the dashcam handled it quite well, though. So kudos to the cameraperson.\nundefined\nundefined\nHoly shit, how can he be so dumb and so lucky, if he was anywhere else around that vehicle apart from the rear, he was a smear.\n\nundefined\nObviously the guy changing his tire is completely dumb but the other driver doesn't know defensive driving maneuvers too.\nundefined\nDat drift though \nundefined\nI think it's just a city street (although it's hard to tell for sure).\nIt probably is. Rain gutters are not typical for Russian highways, as well as sidewalk and just two lanes.\n\nEDIT: It's a street in Kaliningrad.\nundefined\nundefined\nYou're getting downvoted (Edit: Well, the post was at -5 when I posted), but your message is true. Stopping on a highway where people's minds are often on cruise control is an easy way for someone to come barreling into your car at 55mph+. It puts you in danger and it puts other drivers (and passengers) in danger.\n\nI get that the kitty is in danger and my heart goes out to it, but you're wagering 5+ lives by trying to stop for that kitten. Maybe it turns out fine 90%+ of the time, but that other 10% of the time the situation becomes far worse than 1 cat.\n\nIt's the old trolley problem, but with a kitten on one track and the possibility of several people on the other.\nA woman killed two people when she stopped on a busy Canadian highway for some ducks.\n\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/canadian-woman-prison-time-duck-car-crash-article-1.2051060\nI recall 10+ years ago in my driver's ed class the teacher told us not to stop if a squirrel juts out into the road. Our class went into a fervor at that suggestion and we had a 30+ minute debate on why you should or shouldn't stop for animals in the road. Of course if it's a neighborhood city street you're probably fine, but the faster you're going the less you should do.\n\nWhere our driver's ed instructor eventually conceded was that it may be okay to swerve as long as you're able to do so safely and only if no other cars are around. He pointed out that even swerving out of the way can cause people to go off road and flip their car or to swerve into another car which panics and causes a chain reaction.\n\nDriving is inherently dangerous not only to humans, but animals as well. That's the sacrifice we make in order to get where we're going faster.\nIf there's one thing that a near-lifetime of rural life has taught me, it's that you never swerve to avoid squirrels, chipmunks, and rabbits.  Not because it's dangerous, but because you're more likely to hit them by swerving instead of maintaining your course.\n\nThose particular animals are pretty quick, and aren't going to wander into the road and just stay where they are.  When they sense you approaching, they'll move.  And if not, oh well.\n\nThat said, some of these animals have to be suicidal.  I once hit a rabbit with my back right tire, meaning that it ran directly in front of it in that fraction of a second after the front right was clear.\nundefined\nWhen I was in high school a girl a year younger than me died after swerving to miss an animal and ran into a tree. You can debate it all you want but in your real time decision is going to be all reflex. If a dark shape runs out in front of you, you are either going to swerve or not long before your logical brain has a chance to decide. \nwhich is why you have to make it obvious to your brain so that it doesn't have to do a decision when the situation happen.\nExactly.  That's the whole point of the conversation in the first place.  You have to train your brain to know already, so that your reflex is revised to do the correct thing.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nCame here to say this.  It's illegal to stop on federal highways here.  Minimum is 60 km/h.  I think she was convicted of criminal charges.  \nAlso illegal in the UK, with [this sign](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/55ba00b540f0b6151c000027/sign-giving-order-no-stopping.jpg) indicating \"no stopping on the highway\" \n\nedit: I've just realised how confusing it must be for tourists to rent cars here. Between that sign having no explanation and [this sign](http://www.eriding.net/media/photos/communication/040924_cb_mp_comm_sign_001.jpg) meaning \"national speed limit\" (60mph single lane road, 70mph double+), there's very little indicating what they actually mean. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\n[Here is another, girl almost killed while trying to rescue a turtle](http://fox4kc.com/2014/06/27/teen-critically-injured-trying-to-save-turtle-has-beaten-the-odds-family-says/)\n\nIt's cool the guy decided to rescue the kitty, but if you run into the situation keep your head up.  \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\n",

Five steps later and he's not so sure, normally he just flops to the ground in some dirt and then I have to pick him up and chuck him back in.\n\n\nOnce I left the door open to see what he'd do (we'd live in an apartment).  He went wandering down the stairs. Then I think he tried to get home but couldn't figure out which floor we were on, because five minutes later all I could hear were pitiful mewls coming from the stairwell. I had to walk down three flights to find him crouched on a stair looking lost, then pick him up and take him back up.\nHeh. Reminds me of my cats. They desperately try to escape, but once outside, they get scared.  So they stand about twenty feet from the door and yowl for me.  Their goal is to stay close enough to me to feel safe, and far enough away to avoid being returned indoors.  \nundefined\nundefined\nMy old roommate had a cat that was cool as shit, but anytime we opened the door to go outside he'd freak out and hide. As a side note, we'd have a lot of random \"presents\" in the living room. Dead Snakes, birds, lizards, baby rabbits. Jesus christ, so many baby rabbits. We actually kept a tally of his murders. \n\nThen, one day we came home from lunch and we saw a cat outside. It was him. After some investigating, we found that he cut the screen open in a basement window and would just go murdering when we weren't around. \n\nFucker pretended to hate the outdoors to cover up his murder spree. Smart guy. \nundefined\nSuch a good thing he was so docile for you and his little adventure had a happy ending. Thank you!\nundefined\nMom drove up? Cats can't drive. \nSure they can.

Good deed well done. \nundefined\nWe should start classifying humans based on their indoor outdoor preference as opposed to race...\nI will show pride in my Inside-American heritage.  I will start flying a flag depicting a door on a field of vinyl siding.  We Innies have 145 different words for ceiling, but none to describe that green carpet that covers the land.  My Inny ancestors came to this country below the decks of the Mayflower.\nYou bi-racial liar! Only an Outside-Sweaty-Face would know if flags fly! I'm a TRUE innie, my ancestors came in a barrel in the belly of the Mayflower!\nMy ancestors knew people like you back in the old indoors.  Yes, occasionally we would venture outside to collect food, and your ancestors would force us to bring the food to them.  As we would all sit inside your well-built, sealed homes, your ancestors would fart until the air was foul, and my ancestors were forced back outside again.  Get lost, dwelling hog!\nDwelling hog?! Ha! I bet you bleach your skin to try to get to my level of translucence! My great uncle invented hydroponics! We beat him up for making sunlight!\nYeah, well, if an outie comes into my house, I can run and hide upstairs.  If you tried to walk five feet you'd fall on your translucent ass.\nMixed Race Vigor. So you're saying you're superior to me? Pick a card, any card. Guess what? It's the race card.\nundefined\nDAMN INNIES, how are you not afraid that your hardsky will crush you one day? extended stays in your gaols make my insides boil in anticipation of freedom!\nGaols?  You are an outie from across the big water, aren't you?  I don't mess around with you people.  You are so used to the outdoors, you created your own way outside, called the Brexit.\ni'm from the germanic outie tribe! i learned this language to communicate with people far away from the exit of my gaol. brexit will ultimately restrict freedoms of those island monkeys.\nI don't know what Germany is, but it sounds like germ, which are nasty, disease-carrying animals that come from outside, so you sound pretty gross to me.  I also don't know what an island or a monkey is, and your outside aggressiveness scares me.\nwe are many and we spread like germs if you aren't careful!  \n=&gt; germany\n\nhowever, the germanic tribe exceeds germany.\n\nyour restricted innie knowledge scares me too! you're monkey, i'm a monkey, we're all monkeys! think of your dwelling as an area surrounded by the green carpet, now you know what an island is. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nI wish to subscribe to this.\nundefined\nI agree.

I thought it was a great idea since my 110 pounder is not a fan of other dogs invading his space.\n\nEdit: clarified my thought more.\n[These collars](http://friendlydogcollars.com.au/) are ideal.\nOur rescue dog, a Daxie cross, wears a yellow \"nervous\" harness because he is terrified of people due to abuse and living on the street in his previous life. He pulls away, growls or freaks out if he can't escape. It works wonders. People know before they reach him that he might not be the best dog try randomly grab at. It's even sparked conversation about dog behaviour and rescue dogs in general, and the workmen we've had in during recent renovations have appreciated the heads up without having to go into long explanations.\n\nIt's sad that he has to wear it because with us he is the loveliest, cuddliest little dog you could ever wish for. He's just terrified of strangers and now he has a home he is constantly guarding it and us. I'd love him to relax and I'm sure he will in time, but for now the harness helps.\n\nOf course there are some who think that Nervous is his name, not his demeanour... Oh well.\nMy Chihuahua is also rescued and panics when someone approaches him (other than our family, of course). The problem is that a lot of people want to pet him for being so cute so I need to explain that he doesn't like strangers at least once per walk. \n\n\n\nIt was much worse at first but he is gradually getting used to some of the people he sees more often while walking. It took him years, but he's starting to enjoy more company.\nundefined\nHave you tried a thunder shirt? I use one on my wee stress bucket and it works brilliantly. \nThere's a few YouTube videos showing how to make your own. \nundefined\nundefined\nThey need one that says \"no kids\". A lot of dogs don't like children. My dog doesn't like children under the age of 7 because of a traumatic event with an obnoxious little girl. And he's not good with rambunctious puppies. But everything else he's great. But \"no kids\" would be good since they have a propensity to just run up to dogs and touch them\nHell, I would wear one around the house if it stops my wife from asking about having one.\nIn theory, you could make your own - buy a sturdy cloth collar, and take it to a machine embroiderer.\nundefined\n [made me bust up laughing](http://i.imgur.com/K411Eja.jpg)\nCaution: Don't step on me I am smol\nA pug full of rage. \nundefined\n\"May hump legs\"?\n'Deadly farts'\nNow I want a \"Biohazard\" for my buddy's bulldog.\nundefined\nAW!! That is super awesome!! Thanks!\nundefined\nRead this as '...to walk dogs with yellow leashes who don't like to be pets' about three times. \n\nThat was really confusing \nIf you let too many of them get together, they'll rise up and break the bonds of oppression. \nundefined\nundefined\nIf only I could convince my two cats to wear a collar. \nIf your cat won't wear a collar, get them microchipped. Well, do it regardless, but especially of they won't wear a collar. And register the chip to your name! It's worthless otherwise. So if someone finds the cat and brings it to a vet, animal control, a shelter, whatever, they'll scan it and you'll get it back. Otherwise there's no chance in hell you'll ever see the cat again.\nFollow up: update the info when you move or get a new phone number too\nThat's a very good point.  As soon as I read it, my mind leapt to 'oh god, I think I've changed numbers since microchipping my cat.  What if he's been stuck at the vets and no-one can reach me because my phone number is wrong??', and then I realised that since my cat is lying next to me snuggled into my side, that was probably not the case.\nTFW you go looking everywhere for your cat and you had it in your hand the whole time.\nundefined\nOr a permanent number with Google Voice for free\nIt's not permanent, they recycle numbers if you don't use it.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nAlso when you take your cat in for their annual (or bi annual for a real cat lovers out there) vaccinations be sure to have the chip checked. It's rare but those chips can die. My cat's did and I had her double chipped in a heartbeat. Never gonna lose that fluff ball.\nHoly crap I didn't know this could happen, this can be it's own Life Pro Tip. \nThey can also migrate. Not that big of a deal on small cats, but can be a problem on larger dogs. \nundefined\nundefined\nOh yes, I agree. My old, fat cat had her chip fail. I never would have known had they not scanned her. My vet contacted HomeAgain and they sent a new chip free of charge. Another local vet placed it for free while vaccinating her.\nundefined\nundefined\nWe have a friend who lost his cat and got it back three years and some states later.  :)\n[deleted]\nYou're doing the right the thing. \n\n\nGood person, you. \n\n\nThe end. \nIs he neutered now? That will take away a lot of the aggression more than likely.\n\n\nundefined\nundefined\nYou're supposed to get one collar for each cat.\nRight? I put breakaway collars on my two cats when I first got them, and they very quickly learned how to tear them off each other. One came flying across the back of the couch and landed at my feet once. I put it back on the cat, but a few weeks later one of the collars was gone again. Like really gone. I never, ever found it, even when doing the final moving out clean-up of that apartment. We cleaned under all the appliances and cabinets and everything, and the entire place was only about 800 sq ft. I think cats have access to some alternate universe or dimension that humans don't. Anyway, at least they're both microchipped.\nundefined\nMine HATED them!! Would constantly try to take them off which meant jaws and paws stuck. After two weeks of struggle they eventually forgot about them. It's important for them to wear them. \nMy boy would drop the tag between the slats in a floor vent and then tug it off. Thought it was an accident until he did it 4 times in a week, then watched him walk over and do it right after putting it back on him.\nOh, floor vents...I forgot all about the floor vent issue. I had a collar on my snuggles in my apartment in case he got out and he would lay on the vent to warm up. The tag would fall between the slats and get stuck. So then he would get up, pull the vent cover along with him, and freak the fuck out. Like twice a week, I'd chase this damn cat around dragging the vent cover behind him. lol Oh memories...\nundefined\nMine just lay there in despair until I take it off :( the longest running was 4 hours of them laying limp in the same spot. They wouldn't respond to anything, even belly prodding.\n\nLuckily they're both terrified of the outside world, though.\nMy parents had a cat who, when put in a harness, would do only two things.  Play \"dead cat\".  Walk in reverse!\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nMine get theirs off and I have no idea how.  I'll slip them on nice and snug and three days later they're gone and never to be seen again.  Like if I didn't know any better I'd say they had some type of tool to remove them and then bury them but that's not possible.  Right?  There's no way that it could be possible.\nMy girlfriend's cat took his off and buried it in the litter box. We found it when scooping it. \nAhahaha... kitties. This is where SHIT goes.\nYes. =_= They know. And they hope their opinions are duly noted.\nundefined\nI had to try three different collars before I found one my Houdini couldn't get out of. Because he is black and fascinated with the door I wasn't giving up. He is chipped and has a glow in the dark id tag. \nundefined\nThree days? That's better than mine. My cat rips off those breakaway collars within 10 minutes. I could probably keep a buckling collar on him but I'm afraid he'd hurt himself getting it caught on something. \nWhat if you started with a buckled collar for a short period of time and kept a very close eye on him until he was used to it, and then switched back to a breakaway?\nHmmm...you might have something there. And I work from home so I can make sure he doesn't hang himself in the meantime. I might have to give this a try. \nHave you ever thought to ask him if he's suicidal?\nundefined\nNot all breakways are the same, either. Many of the most popular are too easy to pull apart. You should really have to tug hard - it's meant to \"break\" with a panicked cat yanking with all its strength, or with body weight - and that's damn strong! The ones that look like a cat's head at the buckle and a few others are too weak. \nundefined\nundefined\nMine kept getting out of breakaway collars, so we put dog collars on them - snugly. One day, the big fat one showed up without the dog collar and we gave up. Obviously, a wizard did it and we were outmatched. \nundefined\nundefined\nMy boy is so good about it! I have to take it off when I put on his harness, and when we get back inside from going on a walk he will like present his neck to me to make it easier\nundefined\nMy indoor/outdoor cat didn't want to wear a collar either. He'd lay down and fuss and carry on. And eventually he'd get it off. \n\nI'd try a different kind of collar. Same routine. \n\nEventually, I found one that worked and he stopped trying to take the collar off. \n\nI ignored his distress because I loved him and wanted anyone who was able to get close to him know that he had a home. He wore that collar for many many years before he passed.\nI use to have collars on my cats until I had two different vets suggest I don't, the first vet I ignored thinking that it was a little silly but a second opinion changed my mind. I was told that cats can often get the collar snagged on a branch in a tree or caught on some twigs in branches which can suffocate them. I'm still on the fence of putting collars back on them, but I have them microchipped. \nThey make safety buckle collars that pop open if enough force is applied.\nMy cat popped that shit open approximately 3 seconds after i put it on \nMy cats do the same shit, honestly. They have the plain plastic buckle collars now. One of mine was lost for 10 days and came back with his collar intact, and he didn't manage to kill himself with it.\nundefined\nThey make breakaway collars that easily open in those situations. Works well if your car doesn't fight wearing a collar.\nThis. It's fine though, mine has a VIN so even if the collar comes off my car can get back safe.\nKitty Lojack\nYou can get breakaway collars that prevent that but to be honest with you while I've heard rumours I'm yet to ever hear of it being an actual problem. The collar should be tight enough to stop it sliding off without effort but about three finger widths loose (on both of my cats I can slide my pinky-middle fingers under it vertically and it will be fairly taught.)\n\nBasically you're looking to make sure they won't accidentally scratch it off, but CAN get out of it if they have to. It also gives them room to turn if it gets caught by a branch or wriggle free If attacked. If it has a stiff buckle, which most do, pulling from branch won't tighten it (especially if you use rubber collars).\n\nFinally, I live in the UK so won't pretend to know how the US works, but cat flaps are great if you're in quiet areas. Even if you normally keep them inside, you can get modern powered flaps that have microchip readers in that will only unlock for your cat, and will unlock even without their collar by reading the chip in their neck. \n\nWe used to use magnet ones, which cost about £12 for each magnet. We're at least £60 up with all the breakaway collars they lost growing up.\nundefined\nBreak-away collars won't choke your cats out. My boy can get his off in seconds if I don't tighten it enough. He just sticks his jaw in there and pops it off.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nI was rather hesitant to view this given the url.\nExploding kittens is a fantastic card game\n\nEdit: hey people don't all like the thing I like but are sure willing to tell me their opinion!\nEh... I wasn't really that big of a fan. I bought it and played prolly 3 different times with my regular group before giving it to one of them.\nIt's fun a few times, but gets old fairly quickly. \nIt's fun when you introduce some beers and 3-4 friends. 1 v 1 it does kind of suck.

I want one that says \"just exploring\". Cats get sent to the SPCA here all the time and it's a huge charge to pick them back up, even if they weren't lost.\nStores like Petco and Petsmart have self-serve tag engraving kiosks. You choose a tag, insert it into the machine, type the animal's name/phone number/other info, then the machine engraves it while you wait. The whole process takes about 5 minutes and costs ~$9 and up, depending on which tag you select. \nJust $9 for a tag that says \"Dickbutt\"...\n\"I wonder if this cat is lost\"\n\n-reads tag-\n\n\"Dickbutt?\"\nI'm getting a cat just to do this. \nundefined\nundefined\n&gt; it's a huge charge to pick them back up, even if they weren't lost.\n\nNot saying that they *do*, but couldn't they potentially earn lots of money by picking up all the cats they see for no reason and collecting checks for each one?\nI live in a small town full of junkies. So yes, probably a good way for the employees to acquire money. It's a pain in the ass and happens all the time here. My friend's cat got taken from her yard. \nDid he had to pay to get it back ? I would've filed a report for trespassing if it had happened to me.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nSPCA isn't very happy about outdoor cats in general, even if they're \"just exploring\". Outdoor cats are a nuisance and problem - if your cat is outside and not neutered it will get picked up and probably neutered with or without a collar. \n\nA licensed Veterinarian in Texas was publicly humiliated because she went out hunting \"tomcats\" with a cross bow - because in her words \"the best tomcat is a dead tomcat\". \n\nEdit: it could be up for debate, but the killed cat ended up being a neighbours outdoor cat. As far as I know the Vet lost her job but not her license. It's apparently not illegal to kill feral cats for population control. \n\nEdit edit: many us cities have trap and release programs to cull feral cat populations. I distinctly remember reading about a city somewhere that was basically overrun with feral cats. The humane society's official position on cats is that they should be indoor. If you do choose to have an outdoor cat please keep it vaccinated and neutered and keep a collar and contact info on it. \n\nhttp://www.americanhumane.org/fact-sheet/indoor-cats-vs-outdoor-cats/\nWait, what... A vet hunted a pet cat to death with a crossbow? That does not sound like a normal situation. \nYes... I work in veterinary medicine, it was a big story in the veterinary community. She posted a picture on social media of herself holding up the cat by the arrow impaled in it's skull, looking very proud of herself. Disgusting.\n\nEdit: **Warning!

I was in full blown panic mode for two days, until a relative found him online: our *next door neighbour* had seen our cat on their drive a few times, assumed he was a stray, coaxed him inside and posted a half hearted advert online before declaring she would keep him.\n\nNow our kitties have bright blue collars with reflector strips.\nundefined\nundefined\nIn my case I.. need to pet every cat I see. If they oblige and are wearing a collar I tend to check for its name just because, so I'd see this and call.\nNot everyone thinks that way. Awhile back someone rang us because our cat was sat in her garden and looked lost, collars have name and our phone number on.\n\nHe was like 100yrds away on another street. He just always tilts his head in a curious look, so he looks a bit lost XD\nOne of my mom's cats has a tilted head, due to a bad infection as a kitten.  It's incredibly cute.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nHad a stray dog show up last week at night. It had a collar with a name and phone number tag attached, and the owner had been looking for a half hour for him. Super friendly dog and we live near a highway but also a lot of wild animals nearby (bears, coyotes, etc). Glad he went home safe and sound :) \nDogs are rarely left to their own devices. I've only know 2, a husky that roamed the neighborhood and into our house once and a little dog whose owner was to old to walk it so let her go explore. Would always come to our house and play with our puppy and us young kids. Dogs have no problem coming right up to people while cats shy away. People don't like loose dogs and owners don't like dead dogs.\nHuskies. Seriously. \n\nMy mom has one and lives in a small town (250 people ish). She's a town dog. She goes to the town office and they let her in for treats. She goes to my grandparents for treats. She does the rounds, and all the chained up dogs hate her because I'm pretty sure she taunts them. But eeevvverybody knows who she is. \nundefined\n&gt; Dogs have no problem coming right up to people while cats shy away.\n\nI've seen many a lost-dog poster that says \"easily frightened, do not approach, call ....\" And if you think about it, easily spooked dogs are going to be over-represented because their owner wasn't able to call them back, etc.\n\nI've also routinely been walking down the street and been approached by cats. Some of 'em can be downright aggressively friendly, rubbing against your leg if you stop, meowing, flopping down and rolling around, etc.\n\nIt is up to what life around people has been like for them. And these days, many, many people adopt shelter dogs that have had pretty tough lives and don't trust random people.\n\nCats who have lived with owners who don't have a lot of guests will be suspicious/frightened by other people. People who have very active homes with lots of guests, roommates, or a big family? Their cats end up being much more trusting.\nundefined\nundefined\nI need a \"Not An Outside Person\" collar.\nundefined\nAww as the owner of inside only cats I just wanted to say you're a good person! \nThanks! I was just glad he let me get near him.  He was a sweetie.\n\nundefined\nThis happened to me last week while I was walking home late at night. The friendly cat's tag had a name and number that I called, and left a message. After sitting with the cat for ~20 minutes, I get a call back from the owner and get lectured about how I must not be from the area because apparently this cat is some bigshot neighborhood celebrity that likes to sit outside and watch people walk by. I've lived here for 18 years. Sorry if I don't recognize your damn cat. So I simply told them where I left the cat (underneath a car not far from their address) and went home. Next morning, I get a call back from the owner asking if I took the cat because he hadn't returned home yet. I just let out a long, silent sigh and wished them a quick reunion. \nWow what an asshole. At least you tried.\n*meet at 786 evergreen Terrance with $599 and some catnip if you ever want to see your cat again* \nundefined\nWay to go good person!!

The deer followed her all the way to the front door, it didn't leave for quite some time and at one point it would have came in the house if I let it... \n\nHere are a couple more pics\n\nhttp://imgur.com/f9evtQz\n\nhttp://imgur.com/tVb5gMQ\n\nhttp://imgur.com/uI7SBFg\n\nhttp://imgur.com/0ti6BGC\n\nhttp://imgur.com/b2tI69b\n\n**EDIT** spacing and added pic of puppy running away from Deer :)\nI think you found a deer that's probably lost his herd and was trying to join yours. He would have been family if you had treated him right.\nNope. That buck has already shed his velvet, left his bachelor group, and is looking to establish territory and fuck. \nThis. Avid deer hunter here as well. He's the deer equivalent of a hormone-charged teenager. \n\nMore than one hunter who sprayed himself with estrus, has found himself being chased by a red-eyed buck... who by this point can see that he is not a deer but no longer cares. The rut (especially the first, like this poor little guy's) can make deer do stupid things.\n&gt;who by this point can see that he is not a deer but no longer cares.\n\n\n\nThat is simultaneously hilarious and frighting as hell.\nundefined\nHe is a buck. And he is here to fuck.\n[deleted]\nOr his wife.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nI think you actually are probably right:'(\n\nI'm not familiar with the species of deer  where op is from (CT). I'm from Michigan, where we're lousy with white tailed deer. \n\nBut comparing the many generations of white tailed deer that i see in my yard, this guy seems kind of underdeveloped. He looks mostly healthy, but a little hungry. And the photo LOOKS like his hair on his hind legs is kind of ruffled up, indicating that he doesn't have any family around to lick him clean.\n\nLastly, and this is total speculation based on white tailed deer, but he seems too young to have antlers growing like that, maybe an indication that he had to \"man-up\" quicker than usual since he doesnt have a herd.\n\nLike i said, I'm used to white tailed deer, so maybe this little guy is totally normal for that species.\nOk, now I want to drive to CT to find an orphaned deer. \nHe's big enough to live on his own. Might've just gotten run out of momma's herd, but he'll probably be fine. Males are solitary most of the year.\nTIL I'm a deer.\nHe said most of the year. Not their whole lives.\nBRB, going to ER to take care of this burn.\nHe has a family. \nundefined\nundefined\nThey're available for a limited time only, usually coyotes or vehicles snatch them up.\n\n:(\nHow does a vehicle adopt a deer?\nThis is so nice and heartwarming! People have become so acceptable of others that they won't even question a coyote adopting a deer :)\nI just hope one day we'll be able to say the same about cars.\nundefined\n[ahhhh the old Reddit buck a roo!](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/52fow9/thank_you_looking_back_on_ten_years/d7k4kh1?context=4)\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nCan confirm, driving to CT right now to pick up a white-tailed orphan deer.\n\n\nI live in Europe.\nI'm in for a road trip, I'll grab the jerky.\nundefined\nundefined\nHe is a year old deer. They grow little antlers like that in their first year. He is old enough that his momma kicked him out because she had a new baby to take care of. And he didn't find any other deer to run with. But he could definitely find some deer to run with. But yes, they do grow little antlers when they are a year old. I've seen some very small bodied deer with small antlers. they call these little bucks spikes, because he doesn't have forking antlers. Also can be called yearlings.\nundefined\nDefinitely a white tail. He just doesn't have his flag up. Also he looks pretty skinny.\n\n&gt;Lastly, and this is total speculation based on white tailed deer, but he seems too young to have antlers growing like that, maybe an indication that he had to \"man-up\" quicker than usual since he doesnt have a herd.\n\nAvid deer hunter here. A lot of whitetail bucks put on small racks even if it's their first. Also he looks like he's growing his winter coat. That may be why his fur looks like that. \n\n\nThanks for chiming in, being a hunter you're probably a bit more keen on this sort of thing. I just observe the several herds that wander through my yard:) (a good year, I'll see 3-5 herds of atleast 6 deer)\n\nThe antler thing I'm not sure about by any means, he just seems so little to have antlers even that big. Maybe the deer around me just grow larger in general than in CT?\n\nAnd as for the winter coat, even then, their coats (in my experience) always appear smooth and well groomed. Even the bucks. \n\nWhen the bucks get older, i know during certain parts of the year they tend to be more solitary... my whole point of view is based on the fact that he seems too small to be out on his own yet. \nBucks generally break off from their \"bachelor\" groups around October here in the south. This buck may have broke off a bit early. I promise all his instincts are there. As long as he can dodge a car or bullet he'll be alright. \nHopefully he's studied the 5 D's of Dodgeball: Dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge!\nundefined\n&gt;As long as he can dodge a car or bullet he'll be alright.\n\nWell, he's a deer, so chances aren't great.\nHe also follows people around, so that doesn't help his bullet odds.\nundefined\nundefined\nI thought he looked under weight too. \nWorms, chronic wasting disease, getting chased out of territories by older deer because rut is coming-- there's a lot of reasons he could be so ribby. \nYou must have lived in Buchanan because you know a lot about the Bucks!\nundefined\nundefined\nHe's probably been fed by people before\nOnce you feed a deer a donut, they'll never forget a person. Trust me.\nAre you the guy with the son named Money? \nundefined\nI was wondering if he was raised by people and then released. Would explain his strange lost behaviour and why he followed them home. \nThe one deer I know who was raised by people chose to leave on his own and adapted quite well.  Granted my in-laws live on a ranch and bottle fed him just like any calf who's mom died.  He does show back up every fall, right around hunting season, to hang out around the valley.  He is easier around people on the ranch but I've seen him outside of there and he is much more cautious.\nPeople freakout when you yell Rodger out of the truck and the deer comes walking up.\nundefined\nBucks go solo this time of the year.\nlosing the fear of predators is a common trait of chronic wastings disease (CWD) as well. I hate to be the douche but if this deer is infected, it could spread the disease and end up killing dozens or hundreds of other deer.\n\n\nI was thinking the same thing. No fear of humans, looking underweight.\nundefined\nThis would've have been awesome, however OP did the right thing in not taking the deer in. Domesticating wildlife is not an easy process and never the ethical choice. \nThis makes sense, but why would it try to become part of a human 'herd'? Can't it tell the difference between humans and other deer?\nI'm imagining it like you're a person who hasn't seen another human in a very long time and suddenly you come across a herd of friendly deer. Would you say \"I'm not a deer, so fuck them\" or would you stick with the seemingly nice deer? I'd personally choose the deer over loneliness, but then I'd probably do that even in my current position of seeing people regularly.\nHey, you lonely? I'll be your friend.\nAww, I'll be your friend, too. But really, deer over people...any day. \nDoe's before ho's!\nPM me for friendship. \nI'd like one friendship please!\nundefined\nundefined\nIt's a young deer so it hasn't figured out that people equal danger. If it's a deer in an area with hunting they will figure this out. But if it's a more urban area without hunting, deer are often not afraid of people and will hang around people in an attempt to get food.\n\nJust the other day, we were dumping some garden waste at our small town dump. A handful of deer walked up to another truck that was throwing out cornstalks. The deer were eating the cornstalks out of the back of the truck that the guys were standing in. The guy in the back of the truck could have literally reached out and touched the deer. One of the deer was a little buck with small antlers almost the exact size as the one pictured. These deer are what we call city or town deer. They are known to eat out of people's gardens. They don't associate people with danger because they can't be hunted.\nundefined\nI had one try to join my cars herd once. I was driving down a dark road, and the bastard jumped right into my car, like \"hey, whatcha doin'? Can I join?\" They're not smart animals. \nSame, I had one run backwards and forwards in the road a couple of times before apparently being safe and then deciding that running into the side of the car was the best course of action. Deer undamaged, car scratched up. They need to evolve the car awareness of pigeons.\nundefined\nundefined\n\"Hi Mister. Can puppy come out to play?\"\nundefined\nIt's tempting to get friendly with these guys, but it's better for the deer to resist desires for a semi-pet deer. If it hangs out around people long enough, someone is going to shoot it. There was a post on here some time ago of a family that had a pet deer that they dyed pink (Edit: or they put an orange hunting vest on it. Can't recall exactly) so no one would shoot it. It was known in the community like a town deer I suppose, so it was pretty obvious this deer wasn't supposed to be hunted.. Anyway, some asshole shot it dead. Some people can't resist the urge to be dipshits\nThat is awful.  We resisted the urge to interact and tried to spook it off and all I could think is what if some hunter came across it.  This little guy isn't that afraid of us and he should be.  I haven't heard gunshots in a while so hopefully he's safe in our area for a while.\nNot sure where you are located but bow season started this past Friday in Maryland.\n\njust saw you are in Ct. archery starts the 15th and shotgun the 16th in some parts of the state. More info here\n\nhttp://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2700&amp;q=573522&amp;deepNav_GID=1633 info here\nThanks for the heads up!\nI used to live in CT and we had a similar situation (though a bit less ambiguous, it was an orphaned fawn on our property). If he sticks around and seems to be completely on his own, I'd suggest contacting the [Wildlife Rehabilitators Association](http://www.cwrawildlife.org/) and seeing what they recommend. Their website looks really sketchy but they're a great organization.\nundefined\nHere where I live in southern Brazil, deer among other species, almost went extinct. Even with hunting being illegal all the time here, there are people who still do it. Then, some time ago in out farm, we saw a deer mother and a puppy running near the forest. Maybe they are coming back, since young people today have more access to information and understand that we should care about these creatures, not harm them. It's like Jurassic Park, life finds a way.\nWe have the opposite problem on the US. We killed off the apex predators that kept the deer populations down, so now they have to be hunted because they are overpopulated. They do a lot of damage since they are overpopulated. They are a factor in the prominence of invasive species because the deer select the native plants to eat, while leaving the invasive plants alone.\nundefined\nundefined\nI told someone the story of my pet moose as a kid. They responded by telling the story of a family moose that they painted the antlers florescent green to make it obvious it wasn't really wild. It was shot the next day by a hunter.\nA friend of mine grew up on a farm. They saved a fawn whose mother was hit by a car. He grew up to be very tame and have a huge rack. During hunting season they kept him in their barn or the fenced pen next to the barn. Everyone in town knew about him. People would come to pet him and take photos. One day he's not there. Her dad walks out and finds a gut pile next to the back fence. Some asshole lured him with corn and carrots to the back corner so they could shoot him. They could see the guys foot prints in the snow. He had the deer literally eating out of his hand and still killed it. \nThese guys are assholes and pathetic. Yeah, deers need to be hunted because they're overpopulated, but someone's pet deer isn't going to keep the deer populations up single handedly. This is just an example of their disrespect for the family, the community, and for life.\nI'm sure it was some young guy who thought he could brag about the big deer his shot. Word got around pretty quickly and the whole town was up in arms over it. If he tried to show the deer around everyone would have known it was him. So, he shot a big, tame deer and in the end couldn't tell a soul and still be respected in town. Just a waste of life. His and the deer's. \nStuff like that would make me so angry I'm glad we don't have guns here.\nundefined\nI understand we need hunting for the deer population and not all hunters are bad people, but most of them I meet have little regard for the actual lives of animals and don't see them as living things. They just like to kill shit =/\n\nIt's really pretty shitty. \nYou hang out with the wrong hunters. The majority are very conservation minded and hold the animals they are hunting in very high regard. I very rarely meet some one who kills for fun -- it's a lot of work. \nNo kidding.  I \"hunt\" every November.  I put hunt in quotes because most of the time I just go sit in my blind for peace and quiet and don't really plan on shooting anything.  The reason for this is because pulling the trigger is step 1 in a multi step process where most of the steps aren't very fun and kind of a pain in the ass.  That being said, I have shot deer before because venison is delicious.\nWhere do you live? I live in the southeast and everyone I know who hunts just \"likes to kill shit\"\n&gt; Where do you live? \n\nI live in the North. Most hunters have a respect for where their food comes from.\nundefined\nI live here in the South and know very very few people like that and I've been hunting for over 25 years now. Then again, you may be young and know a lot of immature folks that just like to pop off at the mouth. Almost everyone I know respects the land and the animals we hunt\nundefined\nundefined\nI think you - and they - are applying post-Hoc rationalisation. It's true that there can be benefits to culling overpopulated species. But lots of places that don't allow recreational hunting manage this type of culling perfectly well with a small number of game keepers and/or actual ecologists.\n\nYou can't really believe that most hunters are life long conservationists who reluctantly spend thousands of dollars on equipment and licences so that they can do what needs to be done for the greater good of the environment?\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nYou can't make a pet out of wildlife and let it run around in the wild.  You end up with an animal that's not afraid of humans. I once had someone's \"pet\" deer find me out in the woods.  It had an orange vest and a damn bell on it.  It pawed at me, snorted, pushed it's head into me.  I was maybe 12, out bow hunting. That thing pushed me all over the place and knocked me down. I refrained from shooting it, but it came as absolutely no surprise when it showed up dead a week later near a more popular area.\nundefined\nI remember hearing about that on This American Life or something.  They kept an orange bandanna around its neck, and everyone in town knew the deer.  I think the guy who shot it was hated by the townsfolk for a long time.\nundefined\nThis reminds me of the [Dog vs. Deer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnZSTkycovg) video that went viral a few years ago.\nNo one saw your post? Well let me upvote it!\n\n/u/thedorkening  This is basically an alternate look at the life you would have had if the deer had become family!\nI love the two cats just sitting on the ledge staring at them.\nWhy is your license plate on the Honda like that?

Roger grabbed him by the antlers and had a violent little tussle for a couple minutes until he got him out the door.\nWe all know it kicked Roger's ass, you don't have to try and save face for him.\nhttps://youtu.be/Z7Et0a8fnuw\nundefined\nJust give him a banana and send him on his way.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0DzhW.gifv\nundefined\n\"I was told there would be treats...?\"\nDo you have a moment to talk about our Lord and savior Santa Claus?\nThis seems like an excellent development in hunting dog technology. \nDo you have a moment to talk about our Lord Cenarius?\n\"Hi sir can I interest you in the book of Mormon?\"\nCould've been a curious buck looking into mating season.

Be careful out there. This little guy is probably just curious at this point.\nThanks for the heads up, the area isn't really populated.  We're on 3 acres, the next house over is my brother on 2.  The other side of us is a very large farm many acres back, the farmer passed about a year back so not too much action over there.  and we have another side where the guy is restoring my grandparents old farmhouse and he's barely there.  \nundefined\nThere's a teenage from PA who got popping on a twitter (@COLDGAMEKELV) for feeding the deer in his neighborhood and now they all come to his house every day and he has names for them all and he feeds them organic fruit\n\n[This video is from yesterday](https://twitter.com/COLDGAMEKELV/status/775111248044318721)\nThe Curse of Reincarnation\n------------------------------\n\nThe young buck saw the two-legger and its-- no, *her*-- pup wandering in his field. From the trees, the buck blinked. *She*-- how did he know the two-legger was *she*?-- said something to her pup and looked down at it, baring her teeth in the queer way that two-leggers liked to do.\n\nInsects sang their futile songs with great gusto, birds shouted for attention, and the wind lovingly caressed the grass in his field, the trees in his forest, the antlers next to his ears, and the small tuft of fur *she* had spilling down from *her* head.\n\nThe buck heard a twig snap, and while his ears swiveled to its direction, his eyes remained fixated on *her.* \n\n*She* said something to *her* pup and the pair began walking back to the two-legger territory.\n\nThe buck had heard from the whispers of both fowl and animal to never cross into their territory, however tempting and sweet their grass was. He had listened to enough stories of mates, young, and herdmates disappearing to bother with two-legger grass. \n\nBut nevertheless, the buck took a step, and then another, and then another-- all of them to *her*. \n\nHis instincts, loud and practiced in survival, warned him. Learned caution protested. But the buck paid them no heed. There was something about *her* that filled him with deep yearning. This yearning was deeper than the hunger he had felt the last two winters, and more powerful than the late summer sun currently scorching them.\n\nThe buck followed *her* and the pup to their not-cave.\n\n*She* saw him and turned back to bare *her* teeth and vocalize something. He froze. Baring teeth was never a good sign, but *her* tone did not sound aggressive. He supposed that two-leggers just liked to bare their teeth. \n\nThe buck bared his teeth for a moment, mimicking *her* display. \n\nThe pup barked, but he and *she* just looked at one another. Another breeze kissed both his fur and *hers.* \n\n*She* stopped baring *her* teeth and turned around to go back to *her* territory. \n\nThe buck followed.\n\n*She* would look back from time to time, each time increasing *her* pace. \n\nHe merely walked faster, feeling his heart pound despite the lack of danger. Blood flushed throughout his body, a chill coursed down his back, and everything in the world seemed to disappear except for *her.*\n\nThis was dangerous, he knew, to be out in the open and actually following a two-legger into *her* territory. \n\nBut he didn't care. Right now, all he could was focus on *her.*\n\nThey reached *her* not-cave, where the buck could smell three things: *her,* the pup, and some other two-legger.\n\nWith one last look, *she* bolted inside and slammed the opening to the not-cave shut. \n\nThe sound broke his focus and the buck finally observed the world around him.\n\nThe singing insects were subdued, the birds chirped their arrogant songs, and there were no other animals. Two-leggers only allowed those that they wanted into their territory. \n\nHe deeply inhaled and took in the scents again. Deer had no place with two-leggers, it seemed.\n\nHe saw another two-legger peer at him through the opening of the not-cave. Its eyes seemed calculating, like a veteran stag eyeing a stranger.\n\n*She* peered from the opening.\n\nHis pounding heart stopped.\n\nThe young buck began approaching *her* again, despite the not-cave that was between them. \n\nFor some time, the young buck sniffed around their not-cave. He wanted to... he wanted to... the buck didn't know what he wanted to do, but he did know that he just **needed** to be near *her.* The yearning that he had felt at the edge of his forest increased.\n\nBut the other two-legger would not let him. It even sent the harmless, cowardly pup to attack(?) him. \n\nEventually, the buck gave up. He turned back around to walk back into his forest.\n\nFor some reason, his heart hurt.\nundefined\nIs your wife a Disney Princess? \nundefined\nHe looks like a Jehovah's witness, I'd tell him to never come back and slam the door OP, those guys are relentless. \nundefined\nSo this is cute but when I follow women home to play with them and their pets it's \"Stalking\" and \"Harrasement\".

One time I was just sitting on a stump philosophizing about life, and a little fawn walked right up to me, so cool. Same thing just happened recently with a squirrel. Also, I ran into a wild turkey one time and it just stared at me and did nothing. I went up to it and pet it, and it let me surprisingly. I feel like the dude version of Snow White.\nI love wildlife. It's delicious.\nOh dear!\nNever heard that one before.\nundefined\nGood afternoon, folks.

Every time I was over there it was sleeping on the couch in some jacked up way.  \nThey're normally couch potatoes when not racing.\nYeah, I kinda got that.  \n\nI used to tell them that they didn't really have a dog, it was just a lifelike stuffed animal they pretended was real.\nI have three dogs; two are greyhounds. It honestly feels like I only have one (the non-hound). \nGot any pics to share? \n[This is my male hound within the first few weeks I adopted him, attempting a \"sit.\"](http://imgur.com/a/PXCgx) The motion of sitting is actually difficult for them and can be a challenging behavior to learn.  [Here he is doing it several years later, not much improved.](http://imgur.com/a/Xlvrn)\n\n[Here are my two hounds adjusting to our new house, via butt pillows.](http://imgur.com/a/hxgv4)\n\n[My female, being a typical hound, as is her brother in the background.](http://imgur.com/a/KlbQl)\n\n[My male hound with my pyx mix.](http://imgur.com/a/HXlXW) They get along quite well!\n\nEdited fixed links and better formatting. \nOh my god, so cute!!!!!\nThanks :). I found one of the three [all together!](http://imgur.com/a/aVySc) \n\nWe also have a cat they get on with well [also!](http://imgur.com/a/JpxxH)\nThat cat is photogenic as fuck.\n\nSophisticated Cat\nIt just so happens, his name is Sophisticat.\nundefined\nThis is the real r/aww post here\nundefined\nThey all have such precious and innocent faces. I love it! \nI had a whippet for years and he always cuddled with my cat! It was the cutest thing. \nUsing nitrous oxide in the presence of animals is very unsafe unless you know the risks or at least drift racing with them in the passenger seat.\nundefined\nI don't care where you live or how many hounds you have.  I will find you and cuddle your animals so hard.\nOh my goodness, lmao so cuuuuute and the kitty. Is the kitty the boss? I feel like rhe kitty is the boss!\nI think I might die from the cute.\nSuch a perfect family! :)\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nTwo sleek and shredded couch potatos and a snow floof. Good work adopting! Seriously I never get used to their muscle definition. \nSuch lovely snoots \u0001F60D\nNeeds boops\nundefined\nI lost my Pyr this year, that last photo instantly brought tears to my eyes. I am a 26 year old man...\n\n\nEdit: [This is Luna. :').](http://m.imgur.com/5EhtRQC)\n\n\nMen cry. Dogs are family. Sorry you lost your friend, bud.\nundefined\nAll your dogs are adorable, but your brindled girl is STUNNING.\nThat's Winry! She was actually diagnosed with cancerous joints six months ago (about the only common ailment of an otherwise healthy breed), but is trucking along. She's a very happy, mellow hound and the epidimy of the breed. We treasure every day we have with her.\nOh, no! Now I have sads. Give her and her brothers ear skritches for me.\nWill do :) in addition to the normal daily hundred ;).\nShe beautiful. By the way, *epitome\nundefined\nThe second and third links are the same. Your dogs are gorgeous! Thank you for sharing. \nThanks! I fixed them, I think! \nWouldn't it be easier to just teach them something like \"down\"?  Such that they [lay like this](http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d152/Luvmygreys/Foster%20dogs/FosterDogs496.jpg).\n\n(I'm not arguing, just curious.  I've never owned a greyhound)\nIt is, yes! Both of my hounds are much better at \"down\" than \"sit.\" \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nI have one Dachshund beagle mix and it feels like I have three....\nundefined\nundefined\n30mph couch potatoes.\nundefined\nundefined\nThats kinda how I picture Usain Bolt. Just chilling watching some netflix, watch alarm goes off, 'oh shit it's time for the olympics'.\nWait Usain, you can't run all the way to the stadium, then race! ...Usain? Uh... well I guess I'll just drive there then...\nundefined\nthat's what i've been trying to tell my friends and family for years, but all i hear them say is get off the couch get a job blah blah blah\nAbsolutely.  The first greyhound came from the track, was in a kennel, and within 5 minutes found and nestled in to the couch as if they has been puppies together.\nundefined\nI never wanted to get a dog, but I have an agreement with my wife that we could consider a greyhound because they are so lazy.\nI can confirm that a lazy greyhound is normal greyhound activity. They are lazy, goofy dogs.\n\n[My lazy greyhound in a Peanut Butter Coma.](http://i.imgur.com/iD2hk.jpg)\n\n[My lazy greyhound using a human pillow.](http://i.imgur.com/Ow7lqXb.jpg)\n\n[My lazy devil greyhound sound asleep in an armchair.](http://i.imgur.com/YbVPqsq.jpg)\n\n[Greyhound's really are the best dog.](http://i.imgur.com/MnjDLxn.jpg)\nTHAT SLEEPING PIC. my heart\nundefined\nhttp://www.boredpanda.com/sid-lookalike-greyhound-tongue-dog-zappa/\nundefined\nClick on the third one for some major derp.\nundefined\nI've been working in the pet industry for 15yrs and cannot recommend greyhounds enough, especially ex-racing rescues.  People assume they are incredibly active but that can't be further from the truth.  They make excellent apartment dogs.\nI have a greyhound, and the contractor who redid my bathroom called me convinced she was really sick and ready to take her to the vet because she \"hasn't woken up in a full hour\". I tried really hard not to laugh at him.\n\nThe whole \"active\" misconception is by far my favorite because of how wrong it is.\nundefined\nIf you get a greyhound, you will love it to death. I promise you. \nCan I be your greyhound then?\nOnly if I can be yours\nI can be your pear whisperer. \n^^^^yes\n^^I ^^have ^^the ^^gentlest ^^boner ^^right ^^now\nWhat the fuck did I just witness.\nThe Miracle of Life™\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nI second this. But if it is ex racing (which it probably will be)  be patient. It will be like training a puppy. Very short attention span. \nI feel we got incredibly lucky with our ex-racer. She gets along with all animals, never runs off, and only has one vice - digging in the yard. She is also an absolute blast to watch play and zoom around.\n\nMy husband and I agree we will always rescue greyhounds.\n\nMy parents run a greyhound adoption agency (ex racing) and they really are amazing dogs, thank you so much for adopting, it means alot.   We find it so hard to let some of them go, they can be so perfect, and it is just amazing to let them loose on an empty beach sprinting up and down the shoreline.     The downside is unfortunatly the severly mistreted ones that we have to rehabilitate, it is like training a puppy and sometimes the \"you cant teach an old dog new tricks\" really becomes apparent. But they can be the ultimate snuggle dogs. So god damn docile (mostly). \n\n\nundefined\nundefined\nI worked at a dog track when I was in high school. I absolutely hated that place. The \"trainers\" were disgusting, the patrons were worse and they had so little regard for the safety of the employees (I was a leadout). I liked the dogs, though. Most of them were incredibly sweet. \nundefined\nundefined\nEx racing dogs are super docile. Very timid at first, they're (sadly) not used to family life. They even know how to go to the bathroom on command. Competitive life is regimented life. \nundefined\nI never wanted a dog either, but my husband did, so I gave it a shot.  [I don't regret it one bit.](http://imgur.com/9Fv6gf2)\nI can also recommend Great Danes. \n\nJust like grey hounds and whippets, they down most of their time asleep. \n\nMine has not moved in 2 days other than to eat or go to the toilet. \nI would love a Great Dane but their short life span just breaks my heart. &lt;\\3\nundefined\nYour dog uses toilets? Very impressive\nThank you. \n\nIt's easier than it sounds. Due to the height of her legs, she can just \"back\" onto the toilet. \n\nGot the idea from the way she sits on people's laps and those cat videos where cats use the toilet. \n\nTraining was a bit messy to start with but worth it in the end. \n\nAs it is a leaver flush she can even flush it away about 30% of the time (still work in progress there). \n\nNot sure it would work with a male Dane though. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nI tried to convince my mom to get one when I was in high school. I actually wanted a cat, but knowing that I was leaving for college soon and that my mom is a dog person, I wasn't going to leave her with a pet she didn't want. But my mom insisted on getting a dachshund. A super-neurotic one at that. Oh well.\nundefined\nundefined\nYup. My grey is the laziest sack of adorable crap you will ever meet. He constantly puts himself in these weird positions against the wall when he sleeps and my wife and I wonder how that could possibly be comfortable but he's out like a light. That is until he get's his \"crazies\" and tears ass around the backyard. Love my greyhound!\nI've ran a few boarding facilities and 97% of greyhounds sleep against a wall with their legs up in the air some crazy way.   It's always funny to walk down the aisle at night, most are curled up in their bed but the greyhounds look like they drunkenly fell out of the top bunk and froze that way. \nundefined\nI don't even get it, greyhounds &amp; wippets will sleep in any position. It's like halfway towards going to bed, they say, \"Nah, this is close enough, I'm out of energy\" and just sleep wherever their body was\nI think it is because they are so deep chested that laying on their stomach isn't as comfortable as sleeping on their back\nThey have 2 speeds. Racing and Sleeping!\nThe cheetas of the dog world\nundefined\nPeople assume they're super energetic, kind of like giant breeds who everyone assumes need a ton of exercise. But greyhounds are perfect couch potato apartment dogs. I used to have an irish wolfhound in a studio apartment and she loved it.\n&gt;giant breeds who everyone assumes need a ton of exercise\n\nThese people have never met a giant breed. We took my dog to a class to work on reactivity. Most of the dogs were either high strung, highly reactive types or mostly mellow dogs with \"triggers\" that would make them lose their shit. Mine was in the latter so I figured one day, it would make sense why some lady brought her 150lb english mastiff. The most reactive that dog got was being surprised at the sound of her own farts waking her up from the nap she decided to take in the middle of a class activity.\nCan confirm, I live with an English mastiff \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/REAwb\n\nThat's her 98% of the time. \n\nIf you mashed the face in and shrunk her, she'd be the spitting image of my pug.\nI actually tell people she's just an overgrown pug! :)\nThe wrinkles on the top of the head really seal the deal.\n\nHere's our pug, Nala, [licking the plate clean after devouring her birthday cake.](http://i.imgur.com/Erz7Z6l.jpg)\nOh my gosh, they do have the same wrinkles!! Nala is a little cutie :) thanks for sharing\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\n\"used to have an irish wolfhound in a studio apartment and she loved it.\"\n\nWow! My family had one when I was just a youngin and all I remember is that it never stopped moving, and that I could ride on its back. She had acres to run in all day and would still be wanting more when I got home from school. I couldn't possibly imagine having one in a studio apartment, or even worse, potty training a puppy in an apartment. Those turds are elephant sized! I'm sure you were a good owner else you wouldn't mention it, but damn that's some effort!!\nI think pretty much any dog would be into having fun if they had the facilities to do so (with yours being an essential paradise of sorts). Just some breeds are more easily contented/tolerate a lack of such facilities more than other breeds.\n\nAlso god dammit so jealous of your dog riding experiences. I'm 26 and still pretend to ride my 50lb lab/beagle.\nundefined\nGod I wish I could ride on the back of my dog as a kid. \nIt's a bad idea. Their spines aren't built to take the weight.\nWhich is why I wish I could, not am going to. \nThe way reddit is, there is no positive response I could usefully make that wouldn't sound sarcastic. Still, I wanted to say that it's great you think that way, and I'm glad you followed up without being snarky or rude like so many conversations would go on reddit!\nThank you! Unfortunately regardless of how something is written here it still almost sounds sarcastic, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt :)\nIt's true, isn't it? Sarcasm is inescapable. Argh\n\nThank you for the benefit of the doubt :) \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nGreyhounds are the world's fastest doorstop. But they are great pets.\nWhippets are the same way. They're either moving at 40 mph or 0.\nundefined\nCan confirm, own two Greyhounds. They're colloquially known as 45mph Couch Potatoes.\nThat's why they are so energetic when running/racing, probably.\nThen again my dog spends the vast majority of the day sleeping and he's a lazy mofo that wouldn't run to save his life if he had to, so I don't know what to think.\nSame goes for Whippets. They're actually great apartment dogs, provided you can take them out at least once a day to stretch their legs. Then, they burn a day's worth of energy in 15 minutes.\n\nNot many animals run just for the joy of running.\nundefined\nHow on earth is she comfortable like that?\nThat's making *my* nose hurt just looking at it!\nThey greyhound nose is more flexible than a normal puppers. This is a side effect of Frito Feet\nWell apparently my dog is not the only dog that has Frito Feet.\nMost dogs do, as it's a result of bacteria -perhaps, specifically, the bacterium *Proteus* - that live on dog pads. Whatever it is they do, it makes their feet smell strangely like corn chips.\nGot me sniff'n my dog's feet! The things the internet leads to.\n\nMy [Lab's](http://i.imgur.com/UEukiAn.jpg) feet do smell like fritos! My [English Mastiff](http://i.imgur.com/Imo0h5F.jpg) though... does not. His are the doggie feet I always play with, since he doesn't mind. My Lab... was a fight just to sniff em! She hates her feet touched!\n\nI don't think my Lab has ever been as confused as she was. He's not clipping my nails, doesn't want to shake, feet are clean... is he sniff'n em? LOL\nHow did that bear get into your living room?\nundefined\nundefined\nThey get their nutrients from perspiration, same as the bacteria on our armpits that make us smell like onions\nNow all we need is a critter that smells like chili.\nI'd rather smell like Fritos. \nTIL maybe why my socks always smell like Doritos to me. \n\nI have two doggos. Maybe they've shared their bacteria with me? Lol\nundefined\nundefined\nCan some experts tell me what Frito Feet is?\n\"The Frito odor, it turns out, is a totally natural and common effect of the bacteria that live on even the cleanest dog paws.\n\nBut why does that odor smell like Fritos?\n\nThere are particular bacteria called Proteus or Pseudomonas that emanate from their paws and give off a yeasty, snacky smell...\"\n\n-[via TheDodo.com](https://www.thedodo.com/why-do-dog-paws-smell-like-fritos-1179854909.html) \n&gt;yeasty snacky\n\n\u0001F602\nundefined\nFeet that smell like Fritos.\nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nI got a bloody nose just by looking at this picture\nMakes my entire being hurt looking at this.\nundefined\nr/WhatsWrongWithYourDog\n/r/stoppedworking\nHad no idea this was a subreddit. \\*Subscribed.*\nundefined\nundefined\nDid it honk just once when she landed on it, or is there a long, continuous honnnnnnkk....?\nGenuine long-ass chuckle at this.

Has had six greyhounds.\n\nnothing but couch potatoes once they are rescued.\nThey spend a vast majority of their lives racing, and spend the rest sleeping. and that's okay.\nThey really do enjoy retirement.  \n\nMine retired at 3, so he's gotten to spend nine years (so far) being a lazy sack of bones.\n\nIts so sad seeing what ex-racing greyhounds have just totally missed. My gf recently adopted an ex-racing greyhound, and he's absolutely fascinated with everything. Even little things, fluffy things like slippers or pillows,  or music playing from a car window, he loves to stop and stare. Getting him moving again can be a pain in the arse though -typical greyhound :)\nundefined\nI miss my guy so much. They are perfect apartment dogs and so sweet and easy to please.  Mine was the dumbest fellow ever and it was funny to find out his racing name was 'deputy strategy's.\nI feel you man. I miss every single one that I had. Each was different, yet all were lazy. The really sweet ones were the old ones. \nSeems common for Greyhounds.  Use of snoot for sleep stability.  [Our Wendy.](http://imgur.com/AUM8IiR) \nSelf boop.\nResting boop face. \n\"Well if no one is going to boop the snoot, guess I'll just have to take care of this myself\"\nundefined\nLove greyhound! My Mikey could run fast and jump high but never together.\nHow is it to have a greyhound as pet? \nThey are very, very sweet, and not as stubborn as scent hounds.  They learn very quickly, but you can **never** have them off leash if not in a confined area.  They are just so fast.  Have had two and they make great pets.  If you rescue them right off the track, expect that you'll need to introduce them to things like doors and stairs.  Recommend 10/10.\nHow are they with cats and small children? Our oldest is approaching the age where he is going to start asking for a dog and from what Ive read in this thread they seem like a good fit for our family.\nSmall animals is dependent on the dog. Former racing dogs obviously have some degree of prey drive to be good racers, but some just cannot drop that drive once retired. The organizations that rehome former racing dogs around here (MN) will determine if their prey drive is too high to be homed with families with small animals.\n\nBasically, a good organization will screen the dogs and families to ensure you won't get a dog that's likely to go after Mr. Whiskers instinctively. \nIt depends on the individual dog. My greyhound is small dog, cat and small children friendly but some are not. If you go through a rescue organization like Greyhound Pets if America that information will be listed along with other stats about the dog.\nMy family has had two greyhounds. The one we had growing up had a very high prey drive. Many dead squirrels in the backyard. We couldn't have another small dog, especially cats. Even had his eyes on human babies. Our second greyhound who just recently passed, did not give a sliver of a shit about small animals or cats. All of our dogs are small and we have a cat, didn't care at all. Growing up, I loved him to death, they're pretty gentle and i find that they're pretty quiet. Find a reputable greyhound rescue that will tell you all about the dog, many live in foster homes so they have an idea of what the dogs pray drive is and if they get along with other animals.\n&gt; How are they with cats and small children?\n\nEach dog is different - prey drive (i.e. how they are with cats and/or small dogs) will highly depend on the individual dog.  Kid tolerance is a little more universal, but still will vary from dog to dog.\n\nMany have never seen a cat, so they'll almost all be curious as to what it is, if the cat doesn't run, most times they'll be OK, but until you're certain they can't be together unsupervised.  \n\nMost are generally ok with kids; a lot of the breeders and trainers are women and often they'll have kids with them when they work with the dogs, so they learn to be around them and tolerate them at a minimum.  Our first, Sputnick, loved kids.  Our second, Stella, tolerates them.  Our third, Star, would be excited to meet them, would put up with them for a while, but if they got too handsy would end up wandering off.  None of them ever growled or showed teeth at kids, though Sputnick was territorial on our bed and would growl or snap at us.  \nundefined\nIf im being honest, a greyhound might not be the best starting dog for a kid. They tend to sleep 20 hours a day, then get super hyper for the other 4. Many of the other standards are great, a lab, golden retriever, maybe a German Shepard if you can handle it. \n\nEdit: they also are hard to train, and don't play very much. Probably won't fetch or anything \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nThey're goofy and mostly want to rest but they get bursts of energy. Feet smell like Fritos or popcorn\n&gt; Feet smell like Fritos or popcorn\n\ntoday i learn.\nundefined\nundefined\nThey have two speeds of \"fast,\" and \"not moving,\" pretty much. They are very sensitive and love attention, but don't like standing for long periods of time and need soft cushy places to lay, so most of us have dog beds scattered about the house and this is where they are found 90% of the time. I have three dogs, and with two them being greyhounds, it feels like I only have one. They aren't good candidates for obedience and really were bred to chase/run and nothing else (so playing fetch isn't really a thing, and neither is learning tricks for fun). That said, they are very low maintenance and easy keepers in a lot of ways. I'm sure I'll always have at least one around :).  \n&gt; They are very sensitive and love attention, but don't like standing for long periods of time and need soft cushy places to lay\n\nTIL I am a greyhound\n\nHow do they interact with the other dog? \nMy other dog is a pyr mix, so quite large. They both play with her for about a minute really hard, twice a day in our fenced yard. After a minute or so, the hounds are spent and go veg the rest of the day until evening comes and we go through the same routine before dinner (everyone goes outside, pees, plays for a min, then comes back in). \n\nWith small dogs, they often don't recognize them as dogs at all and go with the mentality of \"I don't know what that is but I'm going to leave it be.\" A rare few are too high prey drive to even be around them. My pair visited my parent's house regularly and did fine with their westies, but certainly didn't engage with them the same as they do my pyr mix. \n\nEdit: I should also say that I do walk my dogs at least a mile a day, usually two for my non-greyhound. The play routine is just what happens first thing in the morning and before dinner at night. \nundefined\nundefined\nundefined\nI used to travel the country roads in Texas and I'd pass these large estates that had greyhounds. The dogs would try to race us every time- they *loved* it! They'd get to the end of the fence and they'd all be standing tall with goofy smiles on their faces like, \"Yeah, we just totally raced that car...\"\nundefined\nMine does that too! We were at the vet and he got sleepy. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/zgdDTWY.jpg \nundefined\nDude, your dog is melting.\nI have been thinking about adopting for some time now. Didn't know what kind of dog. After this picture, I have made my mind up. I'm getting a greyhound. I did some internet research and found there is a retired racing greyhound shelter about 40 minutes away. I'm excited. \nr/greyhounds\nWe are quite the cult! \nundefined\nundefined\n/r/Greyhounds \ncheck out this wicked hound I took a photo of http://i.imgur.com/S3NEzvf.jpg\nOH MY GOD\nundefined\nhttp://imgur.com/Zt9Ijhn this is how mine sleeps. \nundefined\nHave two Greyhounds, they are a bundle of derp and aww.\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/7Os67p5\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gOjGPty\n\nhttp://imgur.com/yzqISWR\n\nhttp://imgur.com/KWqbAD7\n[Not unusual.](https://i.imgur.com/uqjxFWV.jpg)\nSo graceful.\nI think you mean, \"greyceful.\" \nundefined\nI've had two retired racers. Best dogs ever. I still choke up when I think about my girl.. She passed away in 2011. She was my best friend. I miss you Faye Valentine. :(\nundefined\nI've had two greyhounds in my life. They are such peculiar/quirky dogs and sleep almost 24/7. Our first greyhound, Ricky, was afraid of garbage cans and sticks. Our current greyhound, Jake, is absolutely fearless of vacuum cleaners (I've literally suctioned him with the hose thing while vacuuming off dander and he just sits there like \"wut?\") but is terrified of any smooth/shiny surface on the ground. Walking on hardwood or tile is like a nightmare for him and he's taken to walking backwards on those types of surfaces because apparently if you can't see it then it doesn't exist.\n\nThey really are such great dogs though. True companions. It's funny because we've never ended up adopting the ones we originally set out to, they tend to be the ones to pick you out instead.\nr/whatswrongwithyourdog\nsmoosh the snoot\nHere's my couch potato, and her lab sister! http://imgur.com/a/nZ46p\nundefined\nFirst for everything. I think I've seen every dog pose known to man but I have NEVER seen the nose do that before.\nHaha. I guess other Sighthounds have this too. We have 4 Whippets, and one of them has a nose which has a gap between the nose and the snout. It can go in nearly every direction and she frequently presses it against her bench and just looks at you, sometimes making heavy breathing noises.\nI can't imagine waking up and having a crick in my nose.\nI'm fond of the phrase, \"greyhounds are cats with a birth defect.\" Explains the sleeping in weird positions, for sure.\nundefined\nI spent some time volunteering at a Greyhound Shelter while I was working with another organization that aimed to help adults with developmental disabilities discontinue problem behaviors and find employment. \n\nApparently large numbers of Greyhounds are mistreated and abandoned after short-lived racing careers. No big surprise there. But the shelter told me that Greyhounds were universal blood donors (for dogs) and their organization rescued ex-racing dogs, sold their blood to veterinary hospitals and clinics to finance their rehabilitation and then adopted them out. Cool organization... And super cool dogs.\n\nLink to the org: http://www.hemopet.org\nundefined\nAm I the only person that thought this looked like a foot with a dog

that.\nundefined\nundefined\nThank fuck other people agree. I hate them so much. But love emojipasta as the mockery it is \n✊\nundefined\nundefined\nCuuute. This should definitely be submitted to /r/photoshopbattles!\nMy ex-gf used to have the most well behaved and beautiful male all white German shepherd. (Ralph) I watched him for her as much as possible, even after we were split.\n\nOne time I was watching him for the weekend and I took him to a friend's party. It was a summertime backyard BBQ party, and most of them already knew Ralph.\n\nWhen we got there the owner of the houses dog was a female greyhound. Absolutely sweet and adorable, but *dumb as a stump.* She was constantly walking into the sliding glass door, knocking stuff over, etc.\n\nShe took one look at Ralph and just fell hopelessly in love. You could almost see the cartoon hearts floating around her head. He enjoyed the attention for a bit, but it wore off quickly. He couldn't get any peace. He would lie on the grass, there she was next to him. He would get up to look for dropped scraps, she was right next to him. He would come sit next to me, she would sit next to me.\n\nIt was so obvious and hilarious that it almost became like \"doggie theater\" watching poor Ralph try to shake her. He kept looking at me like \"What the hell are you laughing at? Can't you make this bitch leave me alone? Can't she see I'm not interested?\"\n\ntl:dr - I'm a horrible doggie wingman.\nDon't you mean, normal 'inactivity'?\nSo nice to see another sweet (and bendy) greyhound on the front page.  Here's our Doodad, and the cute dangers of owning a greyhound:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqQI5tUwQ6o\nHave a greyhound, can confirm they are dog snorlaxs. \n*... Maybe it's Maybelline* \nundefined\nundefined\n",
