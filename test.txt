Weird.... not the Onion, and actually not /r/titlegore ...how odd. 
Yay government!  Regulations have saved me from evil corporations yet again!


We deserve the self-made disasters that shall eventually befall us.

I was surfing at Ocean Beach about a quarter mile north of this spot when this guy breached.  I've always known these sharks were out there, and I've probably been in closer proximity to one than I'd care to know, but it's still wild to see something like this.

OB is just miles of sand bars and probably not the best place for a shark to hunt, and this guy looks small. Guess I'll just go with that narrative..
Maybe it's attracted to all of those slow seal things playing in the waves?
Statistically speaking, you are much more likely to be struck by lightning than attacked by a shark.

However, if you are attacked by a shark the probability of this event instantaneously becomes 100%, just like the chances of shitting yourself immediately and dying ingloriously from fear.


Seals do not really congregate in the sand bars of OB. Low visibility for hunting. Kind of anecdotal from surfing the area but that is my experience.
Agreed yea, I was just making a dumb joke about surfers in wetsuits looking like slow seals to a hungry/lost/confused great white. 
Appreciated the joke! and you have a point. Someone please explain why the perennial wetsuit design is essentially a seal costime
Sharks don't usually come to ocean beach for the reason you described. So this is actually pretty cool to see. Looks like there were a lot of surfers out on that date, looking from the video.
You're probably right! I've only heard two other stories about shark encounters in my 15 years at OB, and they were both probably dramatized.

There are many things to worry about at a big day at OB, but sharks aren't one of them.

wtf dude shut up
Thanks
Word is it was an 8' youth Great White

This needs a "weeeee" 
I guess that explains the rotting headless dolphin on Thornton Beach.
OB is super sharky in the fall because of the bay mouth.  It's way safer to stick to the breaks to the south.

Oof. I bestow upon you the mighty 7 words: You are right and I was wrong.
Oh, much love, just being a cunt. I never make these sorts of comments on your blog, because I treasure it too much. Not to doxx myself here, but I was a prizewinner at guacamole-fest at the haunted mansion the other day!
You are kind. Thank you, and congrats Guac Jedi!
If you find any interest in the Farallon Islands, I highly recommend reading The Devils Teeth. It is incredible. 
Yes. Really great book. This should have more upboats than my pedantic comment. ^^heh ^^heh, ^^upboats
Very cool.  Don't see many birds, but I think I saw a dead body float by.
Probably a raft of seaweed. Smell is about the same, tho.
This could be cool to watch during the Farallon islands race next time it comes around. Not sure if any of the boats cut in close enough to see what they're doing, though. May be a valuable tool to race tacticians.
They keep a good distance. A couple years ago one of the boats cut in close, ran aground, and they all died.
kind of creepy at night with just the light house light rotating around 

i took a few pictures kinda like this... you really can't tell how high up it looks from a picture vs real life
That water is scary, man. If you ever find yourself swimming in it, you're fucked.
I've actually done a Golden Gate swim a couple times.  Marin to SF.  One nice thing about it is that it's easy to tell where you are supposed to be.
Not necessarily. 

Source: have swam from Alvarez to Krissy field 
Crissy* :)
Blame me
Alcatraz*
Maybe he means Alvarez &amp; Marsal at 425 Market St, and by swimming he means walking.
Blame Siri 
She can swim?
Just asked her. She said "Afraid not"
Not really. I swim at ocean beach all the time and that's where the killer rip currents are. 
How do you get down there?
One of the many boats and ferry services
you can sneak onto one of the footings at low tide or hop the fence near fort mason
Fort Point.  

Used to be able to walk all the way around Fort Point; then 9/11, and they fenced it off.  Which is ludicrously stupid, because there are about 1000 other (and better) ways for terrorists to damage the bridge, than to go out under it at Fort Point.
Just walk down Marshall's beach at low tide.
[Thanks!](http://i.imgur.com/sCTSYEZ.jpg)
That's the bridge. The Golden Gate is the body of water between the San Francisco and Marin Headlands. 
...Which is also in this photo...
You shouldn't be downvoted - as you're right - though technically OP also didn't point out whether the title referred to the pictured bridge, or the pictured strait...

My wife: "I saw that! That was on the N I was on!"
How much does the rent cost in that shoe, hoss?
Depends on which neighborhood the N is currently traveling through. 
Gentrified already? Jesus Christ.
Those steps do look freshly painted...
Omg that happened to me about ten years ago on the N Judah!

I was on the stair as it came up and was trying to be really polite to create some space for someone when the tip of my shoe got caught.  Even though it was barely in there, it was totally stuck.

I had to plead with the driver through the intercom (to the great amusement of the entire car) to put the stair back down.  He was of course a jerk about it but finally lowered the stair again.

Don't let this happen to you!
You did the reasonable thing. I don't know why this person just left their shoe rather than waiting for the next stop. Could have been in a hurry.
Could have gotten stuck when going into the tunnel
Someone didn't hear the obnoxious noise indicating the steps are raising
headphones can be a curse sometimes.
There's a reason why you're not allowed to drive with both earphones in/on your ears. 
It was freed with no owner to claim it. http://imgur.com/bF0Mw12
This happened to me once before too... So shameful.. I had my friend go up to the driver and ask to put the stairs down and he said I had to wait for the next stop... So humiliating hahah but also hilarious. 
That is a damned serious fashion faux pas.  Everyone knows that you use lime green sneakers with a black and yellow ensemble.
Mine is a similar fear, but [on an escalator](http://www.snopes.com/horrors/parental/escalator.asp)!
My daughter got a croc stuck in an escalator; she got lucky and it just skinned her foot pretty badly. 

DO NOT GOOGLE "ESCALATOR CROCS". Turns out those bastards actually have a warning telling you not to wear their shoes on an escalator. 
This is why you never, NEVER, put a dog on an escalator. They can get their paw stuck in there. 
Dumbasses standing on the stair while it's raising. That must raise maintenance costs; that mechanism probably wasn't designed to lift an extra 150+ pounds.
I mean, it's pneumatic. Pneumatic systems aren't exactly weak. There frequently isn't anywhere to go when the steps go up. The stairs aren't much of a point of failure in my experience. 

Of greater concern to me is the operators who don't know how to operate, i.e. They open every single door at every single stop rather than using the optional system where people open the doors they need with the lit button / handles and the rest stay closed. If drivers did that, we'd save serious cycles on the doors which break regularly. 
When I come back to SF, I will ride muni with EXTREME caution. 
There are many reasons to be cautious on MUNI.

There is definitely a ship beneath the buildings at 704 and 706 Sansome St. I have seen the bare ship timbers with my own eyes. On the maps I have seen it is listed as 'suspected'. No, it's there. These days half of it is covered by cement. I can't say why or how in a public forum, but if anyone wants the details of what I've seen in happy to share privately. 
Oooooohhhh... please tell me more!
Sounds interesting, please share
Must know please!
I'd like details as well!
I'm eager for deets as well.
Yes please
Pm! I r curious
I'd like some details please

I'd like to know!
Me too!
I'd love to hear! I work right by that building!
The exploratorium has really awesome charts/maps and overlays of the city and boat locations.
Thank you for posting. I am *definitely* listening to this on Monday.
This is why time travel was invented. The pirate shantytown look is always in fashion.
Listened to this yesterday. It was awesome!

&gt; I later found out that even if the polar caps melted it wouldnt change sea levels.

You can't add water to a basin without raising the water level. You're probably thinking about sea ice, which already contributes to the sea level regardless of melt. 
I don't think you understand what you're talking about, or what it's doing in here.

Nice article. There have been a lot of posts on this and it's good to get some expertise on the engineering and impacts that go into this. There has been a lot of speculation.
&gt; But my favorite solution is the one finally employed in 1907 at the Fisher Building.  The owners bought the lot to the immediate north of the leaning tower and constructed a slightly taller, heaver structure there, rigidly connected to the existing building’s steel fram

Well I guess now they can justify a steel sky-bridge between the Millennium and Salesforce Tower..which is probably the heaviest structure in the city and built on bedrock.
Salesforce tower isn't built on bedrock either, they sunk a ton of concrete into a big hole and anchored to that. 
yes it is
Those concrete pilings go down to bedrock, then a 14' thick concrete slab sits on top of the pilings, and the building is built on the slab.   https://vimeo.com/151434466
This is the article I was referring to: https://www.wired.com/2015/11/it-took-18-hours-to-pour-san-franciscos-biggest-ever-concrete-foundation/ which pretty clearly implies it doesn't. It makes no mention of the pilings which are mentioned in the newer articles published since the millennium tower fiasco. 
From that article "In the lowlands of San Francisco’s Financial District, bedrock is 300 below street level. “We have 42 piles that go all the way down and are socketed 15 to 25 foot deep into the rock,” says Tymoff" I interpreted that to mean that they dig the pilings down through the 200 feet of soil, and anchored into bedrock below that. 

why do they keep saying it is?
Really interesting read- thanks for sharing!
Just curious, what about the article's inclusion of the quote bothers you? The article attributes the quote to a lawyer who is probably biased and not described as an engineer or expert, and the rest of the article expands upon the various other factors involved in the situation. 

But I am not totally certain for that exact location in SOMA - is the quote wrong? Is that location not landfill in what was part of the bay in the early days of SF?
It's bothersome because the bedrock explanation has already gone 'viral', and fighting for the truth will be an uphill battle.
Wasn't the bedrock explanation just debunked by one guy here? I'm not saying he's incorrect, but has anyone commenting here done an assessment on the existing foundation on the Millennium Tower and whether it was sufficient to begin with?
Did you read the article you're replying to?  I have not done any assessment myself, but taking the article as given,  the lawyer's bedrock explanation (from the NY Times article) is bothersome.
You're still running with the idea it's been debunked. The Redditor sounded knowledgeable, but who knows. 

Had they tied to the Bedrock, used the rubber pads (the technical term for it, I'm sure), or done something, it's hard to believe this couldn't have been minimized if not avoided altogether. They also didn't address the lean until now, which doesn't speak to working in good faith. Their defense is to say there was no reason to anticipate an issue, but you expect they're anticipating worst case scenarios on a high rise. 
I am taking the article at face value, from which I understood that common engineering standards for this situation do not call for taking the foundation 200 meters down to bedrock - that it's not necessary.  Perhaps it is an option, depending on the design constraints.

&gt; Millennium Tower’s designers relied on an old-school foundation technique, friction piles, to support the weight of the tower ... This has always been a standard technique for building in liquid soil, and it’s why coastal construction always comes with the dulcet tones of a pile driver.

So *if* we take it at face value, then the lawyer's quote is bothersome.  I hope this makes sense and is not disagreeable.
I understand the reply, I just think the "it's not necessary" part is in great question, in retrospect.

As an engineer in an unrelated field, and a poker player, I can see where you can make the "right" decision at design time, and then "unknowns" at implementation time (when you find out the liquid soil at 100 meters below does not behave as predicted) force you to respond.

So driving additional pilings or attaching a counterweight building seem like valid response options that do not invalidate the design.
Construction forces a lot of problem solving. Consultants come in, do their ultrasound voodoo or whatever, and you trust they're predicting problem before you get there. The question is if they cut corners, and performed some negligence, but the fact that it happened, and they waited until now to concede to the problem, puts the liability in their lap. Saying a problem is natural in SF, gives them a built in excuse, but this shouldn't happen less than 10 years in.
I don't disagree with any of this, and the lawyer may be right about the design requiring foundation-to-bedrock, but I do think it's unfortunate that the "bedrock soundbite" went viral because it makes intuitive sense, is not based on an impartial view of the situation, and plays massively into the lawyer's client's hand.
undefined
Did you mean to respond to me?

The quote brings up "not drilling into bedrock," which has been debunked multiple times on /r/sf by an actual structural engineer.  It's a red herring that the author chose to include it, especially at the top.

Yes, that location is landfill, and there is bedrock around 200 ft down.  All of the flat areas of the city are generally not on bedrock at ground level.
I did mean to respond to you, sorry. I'm still getting used to a different Reddit app than I am used to. 
&gt; as long as the settlement is slow it may be that the building is entirely habitable for generations before things get too far out of hand.

All sounded pretty good until this line. The settlement has been shockingly fast so far, basically the reason for all this controversy. Why would he just throw in this hypothetical that's been contradicted by reality so far?
Structural engineer here. Settlement is not necessarily linear. Depending on the properties of the soil the piles are founded on, it's entirely possible that settlement will drastically slow after the first few years of a buildings construction. Without soil samples it's tough to estimate when settlement will stop. 

Which brings me to my next point about this project - there's so much speculation about this tower, but the forensic structural engineers who have both the knowledge/experience and the access to all documents/reports from construction to understand the root causes are not writing blog posts - they are bound to NDAs. The full story here will not come out for a long time. 
I almost bought a condo there two years ago. God damn did I dodge that bullet. I think my neighbors could hear my sigh of relief

Piers and piles can be used interchangeably in this situation. This is article articulates a fair analysis of the problem and its possible solutions. 

I was just about to post the Chronicle article.  This quote resonated with me (the last paragraph of it -- the two prior paragraphs included for context):

&gt; The silent protest by the Mission High football team wasn’t spontaneous, nor flippant. According to the players, the conversation over whether to do it began in earnest between a few players during Saturday’s bus ride to Redwood High in Larkspur.

&gt; Then, before the game, Niamey Harris, a 17-year-old senior team captain and the starting quarterback, along with a few teammates, explained to the rest of the players that they would take a knee to bring attention to racial injustice in America. They asked their teammates to join in so they could do it as a unit.

&gt; The pitch to the other players, Harris said, went like this: “This is for helping everybody else in the world to understand that black people and people of color are going though difficulties and they need help. It’s not going to take care of itself.”

http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/As-Kaepernick-s-protest-spreads-San-Francisco-9226081.php
I graduated from Mission last year and knew Niamey personally. Just wanted to vouch for how good of a person he is and how thoughtful he is on and off the field. Glad he's getting the recognition he deserves, this quote embodies him well as a person.
Very mature quote for a highschooler.  And it’s cool that they did it as a team.  IMO, one drawback to bringing politics into sports is that it often brings divisiveness into a forum that is meant to foster unity.  But these kids stuck together, which makes the message more powerful.
The kids did not bring politics into this. Politics was pulled in when someone decided that we should play a national anthem at a sports contest.
how does equality bring divisiveness? 


Equality is too much to ask for some folks.
apparently 
well, there was a civil war fought over it.
so.. how does that relate to these high schoolers protesting? 
so.. how does that relate to these high schoolers protesting? 
"Bringing politics into sports"

The point was about bringing politics into sports in general - i.e. people arguing about politics fosters divisiveness within a team. 

This particular political point just happened to be about racial equality, and in this case what happened was "This is my view on racial equality, let's do a thing - agree?" "Sure, cool bro" and everybody was happy.

But, remember people can argue about anything... "This is equality" "No, it's not equality" "Yes it is" "*No it isn't*" "*Yes it is*"... if you don't get the point, watch some Monty Python.
Equality and Equity in Policing

&gt;"That conception of equity offers a useful complement to the legal conception of procedural equality. In a way, procedural equality has become a victim of its own success. So few police agencies admit to explicit racial profiling, and so many seem sincerely to believe that their officers no longer engage in that practice, that calls for colorblindness may have reached a point of diminishing returns. But today, the most pervasive inequities in policing may take a less familiar form. There is a danger that continued scholarly emphasis on procedural equality could unintentionally obscure those other inequities from view. Victory for colorblindness can suggest that inequality has been eliminated when in truth only one form of it has been"

Policing Equity - "The Science of Justice: Race, Arrests, and Police Use of Force"

https://gspp.berkeley.edu/research/featured/the-science-of-justice-race-arrests-and-police-use-of-force, [direct pdf](http://policingequity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/CPE_SoJ_Race-Arrests-UoF_2016-07-08-1130.pdf)









&gt;Despite the importance of understanding how race intersects with police use of force, little
research has used police administrative data to investigate whether or not disparities exist.
Because the dominant narrative around race and law enforcement is that crime rates drive
police behavior, we used data from the National Justice Database—the Center for Policing
Equity’s project to provide national-level data and analyses on police behavior—to
investigate racial disparities in use of force benchmarking against demographics of local
arrest rates. Even though this is a conservative estimate of bias, the analyses of 12 law
enforcement departments from geographically and demographically diverse locations
revealed that racial disparities in police use of force persist even when controlling for racial
distribution of local arrest rates. Additionally, multiple participating departments still
demonstrated racial disparities when force incidents were benchmarked exclusively against
Part I violent arrests, such that Black residents were still more likely than Whites to be
targeted for force. This method is very likely prone to underestimate racial disparities
because African Americans are overrepresented in violent crime arrests but Part I violent
crimes constitute only 1/24th of all arrests nationally (BJS, 2012), and previous research has
found arrests for violent crimes to involve police use of force only 1.3 times as often as
arrests for all other crimes (Worden, 1995). These disparities were robust across multiple
categories of force (hand weapon, OC spray, and Tasers).



&gt;Conclusions

&gt;Reviewing the four previous sections, three findings merit emphasis. First, even when
controlling for arrest demographics, participating departments revealed racial disparities
across multiple levels of force severity. Second, even when controlling for the very rare
occurrence of arrest for Part I violent crime within a demographic—an event that previous
research suggests is only modestly more likely in and of itself to result in a use of force
incident—25%-55% of participating departments still revealed robust racial disparities that
disadvantaged Blacks. Third, and finally, analyses of each department revealed that Tasers
were the second most common use of force option, ranging from roughly 8 times to 18 times
more common than use of deadly force and less common only than bodily contact—the least
severe use of force option on the continuum. 

&gt;Taken together, these findings suggest that: 

&gt;1)  racially disparate crime rate is an insufficient explanation of racially disparate use of force rates for this sample of police departments. Given that these departments range widely in size and represent urban cities, suburban counties, and transportation police in geographically diverse jurisdictions, the results are suggestive that these findings may generalize beyond the sample.

&gt;2) That significant attention should be paid to additional situational factors in attempting to
quantify and explain racial disparities in use of force. 




Sports pretty much never "foster unity" in the first place, so it's not like we're losing much there.
Well, to expand on “fostering unity” a little, I think one of the main objectives of team sports is to learn to how to work together with others and unite towards a common goal.  A team with everyone on the same page can be much stronger than the sum of the individuals.  This concept has analogues all throughout life, and is a good skill for kids to learn.
I can get behind that, absolutely. Hell, I used to do martial arts which is essentially an individual sport, and even there, we had a team spirit (incidentally I think traditional martial arts is one of the few places where competition is 99% friendly).

My (half-joking, really) comment was just about how when I think sports I think of "Chelsea are a bunch of cunts," "Boston fans are pieces of shit" sort of stuff that is far more divisive... Even the Olympics, which claim to foster unity and friendly competition between nations, are really about nationalism in the end.
lol, 
So, im all for people expressing their beliefs. you wanna do something then do it and be ready for ridicule.

But what about team mates who dont share the same view (if any)? Are they forced to follow the crowd rather than be an outcast and seen as some kind of asshole?
&gt; But what about team mates who dont share the same view (if any)? Are they forced to follow the crowd rather than be an outcast and seen as some kind of asshole?

What you said goes both ways.

&gt; you wanna do something then do it and be ready for ridicule.

Except, these students sounds a bit more mature than to use their beliefs (that sounds like a majority/consensus) to presume that they can/should "ridicule."  Rather, unlike many critics of Kaepernick, they would be open to discourse on what the underlying issues are, and hope that folks are open to understanding.  And even if not, I wouldn't lose sleep over social norming that makes it a given we have structural/institutional racism in our society.

Good question, but I think in these boys' later decades of life, they'll have good memories of having made a statement for the good in this moment when Kaep has given them a voice.

They may not become famous sports stars, but in this one chance to say something against injustice, they had the courage to be heroes.
Lol, theyre not heroes. not at all by a long shot.

and the ones who took the knee may think that. but anyone who doesnt share the same belief (as i dont, and wouldnt back in HS either) shouldnt be forced to follow just because the team wants too.

Kinda fucked up.

yeah man fuck those uppity blacks they don't know how good they have it under us
As someone who used to live in Africa (though to be fair, I lived in the developed, 'White' part of Africa--though I did spend a fair amount of time in the rural 'Ciskei' area as well as a short stint in Swaziland, both of which are probably 99.9% black, where I was the only white face for days), I can tell you with a straight face that blacks in America have more opportunity than blacks anywhere else on the face of the earth (let alone Africa), with the exception of a few very wealthy Caribbean republics like Trinidad or Barbados.

Blacks have a higher life expectancy, higher income, and higher life indicators than any African nation, let alone other Western nations.

I don't think you know the first thing you're talking about--try travelling sometime, it'll open your eyes, because within the last 40 years, this country has been EXTREMELY generous to black people, almost to the point of placation.
"You have no right to complain. It's worse elsewhere!"  

fuck off
&gt;I can tell you with a straight face that blacks in America have more opportunity than blacks anywhere else on the face of the earth

sure, but that doesn't have anything to do with how black people are treated in the US relative to how other people are treated in the US.

you'll also find that black people have more opportunity in America than they do, say, on the surface of the Sun. not really relevant.
[removed]
Because the goal is equality and not better than Africa.
&gt; Black people are treated just fine

oh well I guess I'll just take your word for it

&gt; and have far more attention given to their plight than say, immigrants from SE Asia or Native Americans, two groups that deserve far more attention than Blacks currently do

good on you for highlighting their plight, and I agree that there's not enough discussion about it, but -- again -- not really relevant here.

&gt;Are you trying to argue against the reality that blacks have it really, really good here in America

it's emphasizing the point I made in the previous sentence. it's a rhetorical flourish.

&gt;back home in Africa

all right, this is the point where I give up on you

because you have made it clear that you don't think that black people are "real Americans", as additionally evinced by your saying that America "has been EXTREMELY generous to black people" as if "America" and "black people" are two disjoint entities

fuck right off
As a white person, you really have no business saying that black people are treated fine in America. I'm white and I know that I'll never understand what it's like to live as an African American or person of any other color or minority.
hot takes incoming
Hey, I saw this on South Park too!
It was so timely seeing this on the news today after I watched the new episode yesterday.
Wow, and hell didn't freeze over and America is still around.
I love, love, love seeing this. I just hope they take their views to the voting booth and stay involved when they can vote. Anyone who denies the racial disparity in this country either has their head up their ass or doesn't care about America as much as they pretend. This is what America is all about.
amen
Absolutely, I was REALLY hoping this would spread and am so happy that it is.
Man, I would get these kids burritos and or pizza if I could afford it. Or a few hundred bucks for college money. 

why? 

They're fucking savs. That's why. 
huh?
He's drunk, don't worery. 
Yep, jumping on a pop culture bandwagon. How heroic.
lmao. just pop culture?
Famous sportsball player man did not stand up for the pledge. Neither will these San Franciscan highschoolers.

SO BRAVE.
I'm not an expert or anything but I think that's how protest is supposed to work.
At some point it isn't about courage, but recognizing a major social issue instead of dismissing it.
I'm so sick of your bullshit, dude. I don't just want you to stop posting, I want you to move back to Kentucky or wherever you came from.
Sorry, bro. Born and raised here. Not gonna stop posting or move, either. Feel free to block me if my comments are too triggering.
What high school did you go to
A private school in Atherton. Trying to doxx me or something?
Nah... Just think you're a fucking liar who didn't grow up here.

OR: you're a wonderful troll.
Believe it or not, not everybody who lives in the Peninsula or even the City is liberal.
Making a sarcastic post on Reddit hating on U.S. citizens exercising their rights to protest.  SO BRAVE.
Why do you still live here if you seem to hate everything about it so much?
I love San Francisco. I just wish it wasn't full of San Franciscans.
Leave. Please, leave. You are the black jellybean in the pile of tasty flavors.
Racist.
Yeah, being opposed to racism and racial profiling is totes a trend.
I'd be more impressed if they were a team from small town Alabama rather than the most liberal city in the country.
Because where you're from is way more important than who you are and what you believe in. /s
What, exactly, is the goal here?  Bring awareness?  That's original.  Welcome to a year ago, football players.  So, again, what exactly does it accomplish?  It's like a worse version of the ice bucket challenge because at least that raised a ton of money and accomplished something.
Love all these down votes and not a single intelligent response lol
mmmmm member berries
ITT: white guilt is strong, SJW coming out in full force. 
Was never a smart high school to begin with. No loss here. 

I used to live in Hong Kong where they had cell service in the subway tunnels before the US was using cell phones. It's crazy to think how far behind we are in technology infrastructure. 
The infrastructure in SF is atrocious. For the "world capital of technology" we really suck at implementation. Denver had a far more robust technological network. I grant that it is mostly due to the 10,000ft to 14,000ft mountains that surrounded us though.
[deleted]
Agreed. Going to Japan and Hong Kong made new wonder why we're five to eight years behind implementing simple things like the clipper card. 

There was a planet money episode on the credit card chip. We as a country are way behind that too. Other parts of the world are already looking to see what's next and we're still fussing about getting proper readers in stores. 
Clipper card is pretty sad to be fair. The adoption rate is far too low still. I've been using similar technology in Taipei for at least 15 years. Not only do they take the card in public transit, but you can use it in some restaurants and convenience stores. The same goes with Hong Kong's Octopus card. The adoption rates for those systems are far over 95%.

The only people who are buying single ride tickets in Asia are tourists. Clipper card is also made harder by forcing people to register. It would be ideal to be able to top off at stations using regular ticket machines.
&gt; Clipper card is also made harder by forcing people to register. It would be ideal to be able to top off at stations using regular ticket machines.

What's the change you're wanting? I got my card with cash and top it up with cash or card when needed in the Bart stations.
If they had card refill kiosks at all MUNI shelters, that would be pretty sweet.
Oh shoot, my commute is on BART so even though I take MUNI a few times a week I didn't even think about that! Now I feel silly. 
I wish we had something like Chicago has, where it's just an NFC debit card that you can reload.  However, that also means you can use your own credit card, debit card, or even Android pay to get into any train or bus.  It's awesome!
Ah, like the Oyster system in London? One card, good everywhere -- but you can just use your wireless credit card or mobile payment app. That would be nice have. 
The Octopus card works almost everywhere. Even inside cell phone cases and watches. 
&gt; Clipper card is also made harder by forcing people to register. It would be ideal to be able to top off at stations using regular ticket machines.

am i misunderstanding you? you don't have to register your clipper card, and you can top up at any regular ticket machine.
Sorry this was probably how it was run in the early days--didn't you have to either buy at some obscure locations or you had to sign up online?
You definitely used to be able to buy them at places like Walgreens, similar to how you could buy the paper monthly passes there. I'm not sure that that was the only option though, and you might actually still be able to do that. I know when I first got a clipper card I got it from a ticket machine, but I was a little stubborn about switching over so it's possible that at first you couldn't. Anyhow nowadays you can definitely buy and reload at any ticket machine. Online too, but registration isn't required.
I'd just be happy if I was allowed to pay for BART parking with my clipper card.
It's US. We love new things, bur we hate maintenance. Something doesn't work? Trash it and get a new one! This works well and drives sales at individual level, but in larger scale, it just means stagnation and crumbling infra. 
My friends from NYC were so jealous when we went from Oakland to Outside Lands and had cell service in the BART tunnels. Almost none of the NYC subway has cell service. LA Metro and DC Metro for sure don't have it either.

As much as this is something people have been demanding for a long time, it's still neat that we're ahead of the curve.

Now if only CalTrain could figure out the damn WiFi situation.
&gt; My friends from NYC were so jealous when we went from Oakland to Outside Lands and had cell service in the BART tunnels. Almost none of the NYC subway has cell service. LA Metro and DC Metro for sure don't have it either.

I'm jealous of your friends from NYC because they're able to travel the distance of BART to GG Park in under 30 minutes. 

edit: but I prefer our lifestyle, weather, and not being crammed into a overly dense city with a bunch of people from the east coast :)
That distance, sure, but I can get from Oakland to downtown SF on BART faster than someone taking the subway from downtown Brooklyn to lower Manhattan despite being 5x further. BART should go more places but when you're talking speed it blows everyone else out of the water.
Yeah, but can you do it at 2am? /s
Well yeah, the train speed is faster and the stops are spread out further. You can compare NYC Subway's speeds to Singapore's Metro or Taipei Metro and you can see that even though a newer system gets you faster trains, the distance between stops will ultimately slow your average speed down.
LA Metro has a Verizon built DAS now with other carriers following shortly (on the same DAS so no extra construction needed). Should be great service on all of the purple line, but I don't think the red line is fully covered yet. Still, BART has had this for years now and it covers the whole system.
BART has had gaps here and there and they're still filling them in. IIRC the Berkeley Hills Tunnel between Orinda and Rockridge is still without service.

That's good that they're adding service in LA. Generally LA has the right momentum right now with transit generally and I wish we could be as ambitious as they're being. Expo Line to Santa Monica, Gold Line to Azusa, Purple Line to UCLA...it's starting to come together like a proper rail network.
I lived in OC, and my experience is that if you live in LA proper you are OK generally with transit, but the Orange County situation is abysmal. 
OC is mostly suburban and people have an ideological attachment to their cars, so that isn't too surprising. 
Uh, DC Metro sure as hell has it.
When I was there in the fall of last year there was no service in the tunnels, at least with ATT
It used to be just Verizon.  It may still be.
&gt; Now if only CalTrain could figure out the damn WiFi situation.

Heh, why bother? 9 times out of 10, when I'm having internet trouble, it's because I'm connected to crappy WiFi network. Unless you're sitting still in a cellular dead spot, cell service is almost always better than free WiFi.
Laptops
Even then, I usually have better luck using my phone's connection.
The cell service across the Transbay Tube is not even great. AT&amp;T is not LTE and IIRC Verizon drops to 3G. It's not even usable on AT&amp;T although Verizon is barely usable.

Compared to what you have in NYC yeah that's great, but compared to Asian cities like Tokyo, Taipei, Hong Kong, where you easily get 4G LTE pumping 50mbps streaming video whether you're underground or above ground yeah, we're like a 3rd world country still.
Oh wow, I didn't realize this. T-mobile has LTE all through the transbay tube with only a slightly rough handover on the Oakland side. It's definitely usable.
I can concur. AT&amp;T gets very rough in the transbay tube. VZW generally works fine in the tube for me these days as does T-Mobile.
I just moved to SF from DC. There is service in some of Metro's tunnels.
NYC subways are getting wifi soon too, iirc.
They're starting with the stations. Stations first get wifi followed by cellular service. Once they finish all of the platforms I believe they'll start working on the rest of the system.
One thing I have wondered about: The last Caltrain tunnel out of SF has always kicked me off my Verizon phone... but I started noticing that iPhone users (presumably ATT) do not get kicked off.

I used to wait with anticipation for that tunnel to kick off some blabbermouth, and when the iPhone came out suddenly Joe Windbag just kept right on talking...
My T-Mobile devices do not lose service in the Caltrain tunnel out of SF. I'll have to check my VZW phone more closely next time I'm on Caltrain.
FWIW, I am talking about voice not data (not sure if there are different quality thresholds to hold together a voice call). Call your voice mail  15 seconds before entering the last long tunnel. I regularly got cut off about 10 seconds into it.
Newer phones have better radio capabilities. They keep improving LTE performance with every version. I would assume newer Android phones also perform better than older ones.

Also, iPhones have not been tied to AT&amp;T for many years now. Mine is on Verizon.
True but it's also important to observe what towers the networks have installed underground. I have both AT&amp;T and Verizon phones and I notice that AT&amp;T's 3G is unusable in the transbay tube whereas Verizon is still mildly usable.

It might be the sheer # of iPhone users (Especially the early adopters and tech-centric folks) that are still on AT&amp;T, but I suspect they built in different levels of capacity. The same can apply to any other tunnel.
Couldn't they just add some wi-fi routers as a stopgap measure? Sure, you can't make a phone call, but you can do 99% of everything else.
I hate public Wifi networks. That SF provided wifi never works well. It's nothing but a magnet which grabs your phone's network and cuts off data connection. Messes up my commute radio streaming everyday.
Yep, I ultimately just erased that network from my phone so it never tries to use it. More trouble than it's worth.
Same with Xfinity or other cable hotspots. They're good when you're indoors with no other wifi and spotty data, but it's wise to forget the network when you're done.

BART tried it.  Last time I tried to use it, cell reception was more reliable.
I thought his was very interesting: “[BART] constructed the nation’s first neutral host underground cellular network that allows competing carriers to use the same equipment”

I've always appreciated the service in the BART tunnels, but had no idea they had to get so creative to make it happen.
The other day I was at surface MUNI stop, and the signboard said something like "If it says resetting, we're upgrading to 3G!".

Upgrading to ... 3G?!?!? Sigh.
The signs use a very small amount of data. Not long ago many [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) devices ran on plain old GSM/GPRS/EDGE technology. This was because it was cheap and reliable. As time has progressed, AT&amp;T is refarming that spectrum to LTE and these devices no longer have a network to connect to. Updating the older devices to 3G is perfect because it's less expensive and is what works with the existing equipment.


Not all applications need 4G LTE 4x4 MIMO 256 QAM with 3xCarrier Aggregation. SFMTA actually made the responsible call here.
Who would have known this thread would be so unpleasantly shitty.

I once considered breaking our office windows. Our old data center was in a nearby building and the AC failed on a weekend. As the temps rose some systems powered off from the heat. The only option I could think of to prevent a total shutdown was to break a window so that cold air would enter our floor and the data center room.

I would have gotten in a lot of trouble if I did that. At least I could blame someone else for the A/C problem.
We don't have AC sometimes when I work weekends in 555 (building management is fucking incompetent) and it the temp climbs to 90+ easily. We have to prop open all the doors, shorts and t shirt always, tons of water etc just so we can get work done. If it wasn't for location this building would be awful 
Everything but the north side gets blazing hot no matter what, depending on the time of day. Those windows are like heat magnets. And with no other buildings across the street blocking the sun it is like a nice 3 to 4 hours sitting in the sauna... except with pants and a long sleeve shirt on.  
If you want hot try the vestibule for the service elevator on a weekend.
Most buildings turn off the AC after 5 and on weekends.  Its "green"
Yeah I am not talking about after 5. I am talking about all day.
&gt;  ***and on weekends.***


Yes I got that. We pay for it to stay on, hence the building management is incompetent note
...and you have discovered the secret to employment.  Don't fix the situation if there is someone else to blame.
When they happened to us (was over 15 years ago) we luckily had a bunch of big standing fans and was able to set them up in a kind of a daisy chain to vent the room out.  Most big buildings probably would have some of those giant carpet drying fans around too.
Anybody else remember a few years back when a water main broke on the 10th floor, flooded the building and water was pouring out of the windows?
This one? http://i.imgur.com/LMq3Wv5.jpg

[Here's the /r/SanFrancisco thread about it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1zto5s/gushing_water_coming_out_of_the_top_of_a_building/?ref=search_posts)
They should have kept it as is and said it was a new Olafur Eliasson exhibit. Building value would have doubled.
His artwork is one of my absolute favorites. The show of his at the SFMOMA is easily my favorite I've ever seen there. 
Not the same building.
Ah ok. My bad. 
NP, I remember that one too.  I was actually there for the 555 california mess.  Water was falling out of BOTH sides of the building, onto California and Bush.  A fitting separated on the 24" condensate riser and the entire condensate system dumped onto the 10th floor.  
That shit was so awesome.  It was like a water fall at 3rd and market.
That was a different building.  555 Cali is not on Market.
Nobody said it was the same building.  He's very explicitly talking about the building at 3rd and market when the water main broke.  
A water main broke at 555 California on the 10th floor a few years ago too.  They were two separate events.
Some of those pictures were pretty remarkable.
I was working on the 10th floor when it happened.  It was crazy.
Anyone have pictures? Can't find any. 
I was working on the 45th floor.  That was a mess.
Thats awesome......
i was a bicycle messenger when this happened.   Made my day
Just watched a bunch more of the window fall. There are a few guys standing below but luckily it looks like they didn't get hurt. I don't know why they're not wearing hard hats. 
It looks like maybe something tipped over inside and caused the window to break. 
No info on what happened, seems to be about the 10th floor. Looks as if it was broken from the inside. Anyone hear anything?
This is what we'd call an 'internal office matter'
I was there!

I was in line for lunch and saw glass falling to the ground. Looked up and saw the broken window. Not sure exactly what happened. The area where the glass fell was already cordoned off, so maybe they were doing construction and expected that something like that could happen
Any glass on the ground?
When I was arriving to work today, there was glass on the ground that was being swept up. Security from the building didn't allow people to walk on that portion of the sidewalk.
Oh shit--I walked all over that broken glass this morning. There were bits of trees or shrubs, too. I thought a car had crashed into one of the trees along the streets, didn't even think to look up. But I did notice that all the trees were in tact, and didn't match the green on the ground.... hmm wondering if someone threw a plant out the window?
Usually glass on skyscrapers is really hard to break. It had to have been a structural issue with the glass or someone was trying *really hard*
Hmmm, while googling for any news, i did discover the Trump is part owner of this building.
It does have a fairly evil vibe to it.
I wonder if he has a stake in other parts of SF real estate. 
What law firm occupies that floor?
I think there are divorce attorneys on that floor.  Bley and Bley or something. 
Board Member 1: He could have opened the window.

Board Member 2: Waring Hudsucker never did anything the easy way.

Board Member 3: (weeping) Why? Why did he do it? Everything was going so well

Sidney J. Mussburger: What am I, a head shriker. Maybe the man was unhappy?

Board Member 3: He didn't look unhappy.

Board Member 4: He didn't look rich.

Board Member 5: Waring Hudsucker was never an easy man to figure out. He built this company with his bare hands, every step he took was a step up, except of course this last one.

Sidney J. Mussburger: Sure, sure he was a swell fella, but when the president, chairman of the board and owner of 87% of the company stock drops 44 floors...

Board Member 6: 45.

Board Member 7: Counting the mezzanine.


Someone call Giuliani.
*Bratton 
They could just call his daddy Trump. He owns part of that building.
Did you delete your other comment saying the same thing? It's just not relevant or interesting.
Not me.
Hey, better than the Leaning Millennium Tower.
Somebody got a little too crunk at their office happy hour!
Wow..... hope no one got hurt by falling glass!
This makes me feel retroactively uneasy about the time I stuck my face up against the glass in one of our conference rooms and tried to look down when I worked in this building.
Eric Clapton's office?
aw that's fucked
Super AIRHORN!!!! BBRRWWAAAAPPPPPPPPP
NIMBYs caused this.

The Embarcadero BART escalators have been fine during rush hours. I just went up this escalator and it's fine. They shut down sometimes for an hour during the middle of the day for preventative maintenance. I spoke with one of the maintenance people, and he said they typically need to make these kinds of adjustments for any new escalators.
but I wanted to be mad about stuff
David Campos is still in office... You can be mad about that! That never gets old!
there there
Dude, you don't need a legitimate reason to be mad about something.  
&gt; preventative maintenance

Is that a euphemism for shoveling out the poop?
No--it's a euphemism for pumping it full of lube.
If only we could use the poop as lube... If any city could figure it out, it's SF
Sustainability. I like it.
Your username makes me think you'd be perfect for researching this
Um, excuse me, sir, but my name is Mad*Pooter*, not pooper. Thankyouverymuch.
It's all the poop that gets stuck in there.  Oh well
And why is this preventative maintenance being done during the time when the Bart is open to the public? Common sense would dictate this maintenance to take place at a time when the public wouldn't be inconvenienced. 
Because maintenance people like to work during normal hours of the day?
99% of Bart's maintenance happens after hours. Apparently those maintenance people don't matter then?
&gt;99% of Bart's maintenance happens after hours.

You're conflating rail maintenance with other maintenance. Most BART maintenance happens during regular business hours in their maintenance yards.

That said, when installing a new piece of equipment like an escalator or elevator, its extremely common to have service contracts with a third party (sometime the same vendor that installed). If that's the case here - those guys work regular business hours (unless there's an emergency call).
You do realize that that all car cleaning, janitorial work, and other major maintenance happens after hours right? It's far more than rail maintenance. 

At least the third party contractor argument makes more sense. But it certainly highlights the fact that Bart has less than zero interest in maintaining the system in a way that causes minimal impact on the public. 
*If* BART management is competent and thinking through this, they are weighing (where possible) paying the salary premium for late-night / off-hours maintenance people vs. the inconvenience of patrons during mid-day / light operating hours.  

Obviously, of course, maintenance on certain things like the rails and other infrastructure can't happen when its actively being used.
Common sense would mean that if you have to do maintenance on it every day, you're doing something very wrong.
Union Contract. They'd have to pay double their regular wages during off hours such as graveyard shift. That's what happens with skilled labor such as elevator tech.

"Brand new escalator being appropriately maintained" doesn't quite have the same ring to it.
OP works for buzz feed or tabloids
In SF, "being appropriately maintained" is more newsworthy than it being broken.
You mean Mitch Hedberg lied to us?!
no that escalator is still temporarily stairs. They just don't want you to use their fancy motorized stairs for some reason
You're right. Good. 
I used to post Mitch Hedberg jokes on the internet. I still do, but I also used to too.
"The escalator has become stairs, sorry for the convenience"
:'(

My office moved so I don't use that escalator. RIP my buddy. 
You have strange feelings for machines. I can sympathize.
A fervent supporter of /r/botsrights, I suspect.
Poop?
Bless this brave soul.
Tell your employer to pay their taxes
:-/ I was just there last night and it was working perfectly ok. Sigh.
It's really hard to depict a broken escalator without using a gif. A still photo just doesn't really get the message across as well.
Let me guess: it is already fully corroded from the endless stream of hobo piss that has no doubt been unleashed upon it?
My assumption is that it's made of the exact same cheap Chinese steel as the rapidly corroding Bay Bridge.
Escalator?! I thought it was Shitscalator. TIL...
Where are miscreants supposed to shit now?
Bart's incompetence knows no bounds.  This bullshit is why I'm voting no on November.  They shouldn't be given any extra money until they get their shit together.
The bond in November is restricted in what the money can be spent on - that means it will NOT go to wages of the Bart workers no matter what. 

The money is needed for the repair and maintenance of the system. Please don't vote no, Bart needs to be improved and expanded, not choked to death slowly. 

Do you want more system outages every week because of accumulating maintenance and safety issues that there is no money to fix? Because that's how you get more outages and delays.
Would this bond also have a restriction on what happens to the cashflow BART currently gets? I just wonder if BART management will go, "Hey we now have the money from the bond for repairs, so we can put more of the original cashflow in our pockets."

Not being sarcastic, just really curious if there is anything in place preventing that from happening?
Exactly.  Money is fungible.
Nope. Knowing how incompetent they are. Even if they are required to they'll just tailor their books somewhere else. 
How has BART responded to the "budget back-filling" accusations that these commenters or the [East Bay Times article](http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/09/13/editorial-reject-barts-3-5-billion-bond-measure-east-bay-times/) making the rounds have levied against their "restricted spending" assurances? Genuinely curious. 
Yes the bond money is restricted.  However, what is stopping them from diverting non-bond funds that are currently used for maintenance to bullshit (like six-figure incomes for station agents) as soon as they get the bond money?  

Edit:  funny how none of the Bart shills have an answer to this 
&gt;that means it will NOT go to wages of the Bart workers no matter what. 

Never underestimate the accounting trickery that goes into embezzling funds. BART is overdue for a harsh punishment.
The expansions are what's choking it to death. The income from them does not keep pace with the increased maintenance costs they impose on the system.
The expansions are what's helping the metro area grow with the influx of newcomers. Not properly funding our public infrastructure is what's choking it to death.

Vote yes, even if you drive. Can you imagine another 400,000 cars commuting on the freeways?
The problem I have with the expansions is that they're not doing a good job helping the metro area grow and cope with more people. Every additional station means more trains are needed, since they'll take longer to traverse the entire system. Certainly the system needs proper funding, but it should be focused toward improving capacity in the center, where it's needed, instead of extending the system to low-usage stations that cost a lot and sap capacity.
I'm not sure how often you ride Bart but they've been adding more trains that don't ride the whole route to help ease congestion. For example during rush hour some trains run only from Concord to Montgomery and in the evening I've seen some trains that only run to 24th St and then turn around to help ease congestion downtown for commuters heading to the East Bay. 

Bart will only get worse if people don't approve this desperately needed funding. And the immediate effect will be more cars on the freeway which will lead to increasing gridlock for everyone. 
And your inability to see anything outside of what you already want to believe is why that's a completely nonsense opinion. Look at the top comment on this thread. Someone asked about the situation. It's not broken. It's a new escalator and they're adjusting it. Learn to think and not just feel.
[removed]
Oh shit! I said something good about Bart. I must be shillin all over the place! Clearly I couldn't just be someone who uses Bart to get to work and doesn't want idiots to fuck up it's one chance to finally get repaired!
What the hell is with this bullshit? There's a disturbing trend of "Anyone who disagrees with me is a shill and inherently dishonest." It destroys any possibility of discussion. It's pure poison.
Propose a way of fixing things instead of just complaining.
he posted garbage filth on reddit, what more do you people want!?
He's one of this sub's many regular trolls, don't engage.
Here's an idea, what about a full escalator length cover made of plastic tarping material that can go over the escalator when it's off/closed so that if someone pisses on it, it will stream down that instead of into the escalator. 
Unfortunately BART uses a nonstandard gauge plastic tarp, and getting it custom built will cost $187 million per escalator and take 5 years. 
Only 5 years? Even I might be able to realize the benefits!
1. Eliminate the BART unions and cancel the contracts said unions negotiated.
2. Purge management.
3. Purge all the feckless employees.
Unless you have a plan to elect someone and grant them unprecedented executive power to do those things, everything you listed is a political impossibility.
Fire all BART employees and start over. Completely privatize the service so that they're not stealing taxpayer dollars to sit on their duffs all day and embezzle funding while letting the infrastructure rot.
ahahah that one is ALWAYS dead

She's not wrong...
I agree. I'd also add that she's a bullshit ass supervisor.
By principal, an SF supervisor has to be full of shit and an overall terrible human being to win enough votes to get the job in the first place.

That being said, she's my favorite supervisor. 
My favourite supervisor has always been Mark Farrell, he's a rare fiscally conservative voice in a city that loves burning piles of money towards stupid vanity projects just to virtue-signal, never stands in the way of development (which in a city in desperate need of housing and growth, is a good thing) and has very high approval ratings for his district (which mostly covers Pacific Heights, Laurel Heights, Marina, etc.). 

Unfortunately, I live just outside his district, and I'm stuck with Aaron Fuckin' Peskin.

Anyway, I'm glad to see London Breed, despite being a pathetic communist acolyte, has matured enough to side with development  and growth (Translation: more jobs and cheaper rent) against the special interests of the NIMBY class, who would rather see this city impoverished than wealthy and prosperous if it meant they could keep it in it's proverbial 'local' state.
Vote against Peskin buddy.
Easy to say negative comments with nothing to back it up
This is truth.
Yup. It's not enough to criticize, let's come up with solutions instead of pointing blame. 
I mean she's right...
Finally, someone with balls in this town... and it's a woman!
Just figured out who I'm voting for. 
I don't think you can vote for her, if you live in the Outer Sunset.
I know, shame.
Don't worry; she'll be running for mayor in 2019. 
Let's hope so. 
Let's be realistic. Calling out someone's opinion on their blog isn't so ballsy, and Redmond never said anything untrue about Breed. The guy was chief editor of the Bay Guardian so it's not like we don't know what political slant 48 hills is going to have.

Calling it a bullshit ass blog seems mildly embarrassing. Just do your job and figure that some publications are going to have opinions about you. It's politics.
She's stood up to Brown and Pak enough times to be considered ballsy in my book. 
Yeah, I guess ballsy like the clowns who downvoted me, not for the discussion, but for disagreeing with me. Fucking clowns.

Dean Preston for D5.
I think it's well worth posting the blog's response:

http://48hills.org/2016/09/15/love-letter-london-breed/

I don't agree with Tim Redmond all the time. He's clearly a NIMBY, I got here first, screw you all kind of "progressive", who doesn't understand economics, but he's not wrong here.
Well it's interesting that in one of the blog post he links to, and which discusses Breed, is edited and there is no idea of when or how much or what was edited, so she may have made a valid point, and he retroactively edited the blog post, but we have no way of knowing.

ON the plus side at least he let us know it was edited.
You can see the original text [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160912105329/http://48hills.org/2016/09/11/agenda-sept-12-18-plea-political-honesty/). It looks like the original text was written by a 3rd grader given the difficulty in following who's being referred to at which point so I can see why he'd want to go back and edit it.

Essentially he's claiming that while Breed did beat one of the Mayors appointees (Olague) to get on the board the mayor was upset with Olague because of a single vote to retain the sheriff and thus helped Breed win the election. In exchange she's been voting the mayors way in the majority of contested decisions ever since.

&gt; The same thing is going on in D5, where Sup. London Breed has been telling people that she “ran against the mayor’s appointee” four years ago and has been doing everything she can to distance herself from Ed Lee. The reality is that four years ago, the mayor’s appointee for D5, Christina Olague, had infuriated the mayor by voting to retain Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, and by the time Breed was running, had completely dropped any support for her and was working behind the scenes to defeat her. Breed had the backing of the mayor’s allies, and in the past four years, on the vast majority of contested votes, she has been on the side of the mayor’s 6-5 majority (until last year, when the majority shifted and a tenant lawyer, Dean Preston, challenged her from the left).

Could try the wayback machine to see if it was archived.
https://archive.org/web/
I'm confused by the response.  Sup. Breed seems quite disproportionately hostile for what is otherwise a reasonably matter-of-fact discussion of political affiliation.  It felt surprisingly non-inflammatory, so I'm left wondering if I'm missing some important background on the author or Sup. Breed.

Edit: This post initially misidentified London Breed as Representative Breed.
She's not a Rep; she's a Sup. 
Fixed.  Thanks!
She's been known to go off on people sometimes. I'm sure Tim Redmond gets under her skin. He's been reporting on SF city government for decades. I imagine they have a lot of history.
"Progressive"
I'm sold. If she's running for mayor against peskin or Kim soon, I'm with London. :)
I like her
So, is Sup London Breed similar to Anthony Kennedy when the Supreme Court had 9 justices?
All I can say for sure is that she's kinda ratch when she orders at a bar.
Vodka Red Bulls with a Long Island Iced Tea pickle back chaser?

Cosmo. Not specific on the vodka "Just make it good". More approach than actual order.
Nothin' wrong with a cosmo.  And high-end vodka in a cocktail is bullshit: the whole point of vodka is that you DON'T taste it, and unless the well stuff is paint thinner, you won't.
Like I said, more approach than order
I heard that Ross Mirkarimi was a bad tipper. So, maybe she is better bar patron. This is important for district 5. Oh, and she doesn't beat her spouse.
He is a very bad tipper! His wife is a great tipper.
I can completely picture that. 
She is correct. Love how progressives feel free to hate on black women.
TIL disagree = hate.
YEAH TOTALLY WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME
Yeah, we feel free to hate on everyone. She's okay sometimes, but she frequently votes with Ed Lee (aka Willie Brown) and the Realtors so she's signing up for it.

There was a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/51qj25/university_of_california_hires_indiabased_it/) on /r/sysadmin the other day about this.  Apparently the company they're using is particularly bad/incompetent.

Yeah HCL is that bad.
God forbid US based organizations provide jobs for US citizens.
Let alone a state university. Gotta keep up those excessive salaries for the Regents!
The UC system has been completely corporatized. It's all about revenue first and foremost. 
Janet Napolitano surely deserves those millions, based on her record of failure and no experience in education! 
The regents do NOT get paid, I worked for those jackasses for 5 years. It's a volunteer job with a lifetime of business connections.
Ran the mics at the meetings, they would gummy a raise so I quit. Fuckem I'm union now.


I stand corrected but was almost correct. Look at the proposed salaries for "certain members of the senior management group": http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/aar/julyc.pdf

I'm still angry. 
I've always thought it is a huge conflict of interest that Regent Richard Blum(Dianne Feinstein's husband) has big investments in ITT Technical Institute (RIP!) and online university Career Education Corporation.

There was a tenured UCSF professor who had an extensive website describing all of Blum's conflict of interests but I can't find it right now.

That's the thing, though: it's currently not a level playing field, but the field is currently tilted in *your* favor, not the piss poor semi-qualified IT services workers in India. What you are seeing here is the playing field become more level, and you're complaining about it because you (quite understandably) want to hold on to your advantage.

That's perfectly fine, and I sympathize, but don't pretend that you're fighting *for* a level playing field.
It's becoming one. You and techs in India can both work for ten dollars an hour. Learn to simplify. You are not entitled to a high or even a living wage.

I'm glad the UC system is able to save this money in order to fund an [even more bloated administration system](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-uc-spending-20151011-story.html). Glad my chancellor got a $350/k salary while she was on the board of Devry University! /s
Which chancellor is this?
[UCD](http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/education/article63348912.html)

[And I was mistaken. It was $400k, not 350](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=linda%20katehi%20salary)
Oh, this hag again...

How many regents did she blow to get that position in the first place? Jesus. 
While this woman seems like a cunt, there is no reason to say she blew people to get to her position. She got her position by being a stone cold cunt and making money, just like any dude in her position would be a stone cold cunt focused purely on making money.
Dudes will fuck other dudes to get ahead as well.  Have you learned nothing from Mr. Robot?
To be fair, she was only on the Devry board for a week, until pure shame made her give it up.

Almost every time a company does it, they come to regret it within a few years. What a short-sighted decision.

Not to mention that it should be illegal to replace FTE's with a contractor when the contractor's employees are mostly H1-B's and offshore. It should be treated the same as directly replacing them with H1-B's.
Joe Bengfort is completely short-sighted. He has done this before on a smaller scale, and ended up trying to rehire the positions he replaced, or getting contractors in to help. A few years back, he really made himself look like an idiot when a lot of IT between the Medical Center and campus merged. Joe came from the Medical Center side, and when he became CIO and the merge started he laid off a lot of campus employees. The even more fucked up part is that Joe came from Dell and hired a ton of people from Dell when he started working at UCSF Medical Center. He hired a "friend" of his from Dell to be the CISO of the Medical Center. When the merge occurred, there was two CISO's, one from Medical Center and one from campus, and you can guess which one got to keep their job. The funny thing is, once his friend became CISO for both MC and campus, two weeks later he announced he was going back to Dell. Joe ended up trying to get the campus CISO back, but that guy had already taken up a better offer elsewhere.
Yikes. Sad to see this happen to such an institution. I kind of expect this to happen with shitty companies but a major UC is unfortunate.
For the most part I'm not really for H1B...that being said, I've never interacted with an IT Services person within a non-profit, gov't org, or university that was actually competent and merited &gt;50k / year salary. I'm sure there are some.

With cloud services and the ability to leverage software you don't really need an in house IT team unless your core function *is* IT/tech. Universities need class scheduling software (blackboard, etc), communication tools, a website, and an automated hardware management system. They don't need a full service IT department.
Unless that university also a hospital system and IT is responsible for clinical systems too, which is the case for almost all the UC system schools.
&gt; I've never interacted with an IT Services person within a non-profit, gov't org, or university that was actually competent and merited &gt;50k / year salary

I think anyone in the Bay Area with a white collar job merits &gt;50k. The issue is that they pay $60k if you're lucky, and everyone halfway competent can get a better private-sector job that pays 20-40% more.

I promise you the cheap contractors they are being replaced with will be even less competent.

Clearly there is a need for an IT department. The extent of it doesn't really matter -  they will get less effective service out of these contractors for any given level of "need", I guarantee it.
Sorry, but a "white collar" job is not deserving of any particular salary. If your position holds $X value to the organization per year, that's what you should be paid. If it doesn't make sense to hire a particular job in a particular area, employers have no obligation to keep your job in your area. They know the downsides of outsourcing - it's a trade off to the tune of what sounds like $30 million savings. IT support jobs like this are the low wage jobs of the future. 
&gt; Sorry, but a "white collar" job is not deserving of any particular salary. If your position holds $X value to the organization per year, that's what you should be paid.

Heh funny that a lot of people in this sub regularly make the same exact argument for pretty much every job they see as 'beneath them' and use the same thinking for being anti-minimum wage hikes, but the second you use the same logic for tech jobs it's instant downvotes. 
Right! The hypocrisy is real. Just because a bunch of stay at home retiree's remember the "good ole' days" of tech (rolls eyes) they expect these jobs to be around forever when it's absolutely not the case. Our job structure is changing rapidly and those who don't realize this will be left out in the cold.  We live in a capitalist society, like it or not, and jobs don't get to just stick around because someone once was paid well doing X.
&gt;IT support

You realize it's not just support right? It's the people who run the network, servers, internal applications, etc.

Anyway, I'm not going to argue with you further. You're a salty worker, /u/saltyworker.
Hah, not arguing just a healthy debate. 

I would say that those jobs should be contracted out too: why is a university trying to run networks and develop internal applications? Seems like a waste of resources and expertise. This method of staffing went out the window with cloud services model. You don't need a networking person, a systems person, server person etc. you need 1 IT manager and a variety of services. 
&gt;run networks

Because they have a network. Every computer in the building needs a network connection. Hence, someone must run the network. They must design it, choose firewalls, choose switches, configure all of them, choose wireless access points and where they go, configure those, set up QoS to prevent abuse of the network, etc.

&gt;develop internal applications

A) Even if you use other people's applications, someone needs to configure them, run them, upgrade them, etc (sysadmin)

B) It's not uncommon for the available third-party software to not have the features or integrations with other software you need. Sometimes you end up writing your own, or you at least write the glue that allows the two pieces of software to talk to each other (say, an exam scheduling system and the class registrar system)
As an IT contractor I totally get all of this. I'm not debating about what needs to be done, I'm questioning if the university should internally provide this service. 

In today's market the cloud service provider will also provide setup and service contracts (exactly what they did here). You can contract out network design and maintenance. There's no reason to do these functions in house - the viability of the university doesn't depend on the quality of its IT. We just instinctually want to keep these jobs because they have historically been necessary (and good paying) but now they are not. 
"As a contractor, I think all of these things should be handled by contractors". No kidding eh? 

The idea is that these systems always need maintenance and upgrades. Contracting is good for peak loads but more expensive than FTE for steady-state capacity for the same quality employee. You should know that. 

The fact that they are using an H1-B-dependant contractor is just icing on the shitcake.

As an IT person, I think you're incorrect.  You need to have a team of people watching out for the University's best interest, while saving them as much money as possible.  Contracting out IT work is the best way to get the worst service for the highest price, while paying for it year over year instead of recouping costs as time goes on.  I agree that hosted services are a great thing that should be leveraged heavily where it makes sense, but to say that a University that has tens of thousands of students a semester comes through it's doors doesn't need a competent IT staff (not just a manager + MSP) is short-sighted in my opinion.  
Keep dreaming. You're gonna be laid off within the decade, pal.
I don't work in IT. But you are certainly welcome to live in your dreamland.
Dreamland? Outsourcing is real.
Of course. But effectively outsourcing actual tech companies in any significant number, that is dreamland. 
You've never seen that before? I sure have.
This is where regulations get us.
Maybe if IT wasn't so prohibitively expensive, they wouldn't be forced to outsource. 
Why do you think IT is "prohibitively" expensive? Plenty of companies manage to employ citizens for their IT departments. 

Just because they want to save money doesn't mean they can't afford it. What if they did the same thing with professors? You get what you pay for.
If American IT professions offered to work cheaply enough, this wouldn't be necessary. We're a global economy now. Get used to it. 
You are laughably naive. You think that American IT workers, including the ones living in the SF bay area, should offer their services for the same rate as someone living in Bangalore, India. I've worked in tech for 15 years and I've never been involved in a single project involving outsourced IT or development to a foreign country that wasn't a complete train wreck. It was always done by short-sighted companies trying to briefly increase their bottom line while running on the fumes of the systems and programs that the former IT department and developers set up. Eventually things fall into a state of disrepair, the contractor wants four times as much money as they did when the contract was first negotiated to fix everything, and then the company says "Gee, if it's that much money we should just run it in house". 
This. I've worked with Indian IT people before and their quality sucks. Basically they spend 3x as much fixing what they originally were supposed to build correctly.

Do you think Indians are stupider or something? I think you're just a racist.
Nope. I don't think that Indians are "stupider". I think there are huge efficiency issues when groups of people with language and cultural barriers in vastly different time zones try to work on a project together. Furthermore, I think that offshore contractors are so far removed from the company that they're providing work for that they're not motivated or invested enough to provide quality work. They also experience a ton of turnover that creates instability in the services that they provide. 

But yeah, I guess if you don't have any valid argument to make against what I said you can just go with "you're racist!"
&gt;I think there are huge efficiency issues when groups of people with language and cultural barriers in vastly different time zones try to work on a project together.

This is an easy fix. Compromise the amount of time you're willing to spend at work (taking a call at 3 AM for example), and maybe learn a few words of Hindi so that they don't have to do all the work learning *your* language. 
"easy"
I've taught myself French, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese,  Korean, Tagalog, Latin, Arapaho, Navajo, and other languages for fun on the side. I'm sure picking up just one won't be that hard.

&gt;You think that American IT workers, including the ones living in the SF bay area, should offer their services for the same rate as someone living in Bangalore, India.

Yes? Just live ten to a room like FOB immigrants. If they can do it, so can people who want to work in IT badly enough.
If you think IT is expensive, you should look at what universities pay outside counsel for legal services sometime 
And if the new team sucks they are locked in for five years and have pissed a lot of talent off. Such long term vision.
Current leadership who made the call to outsource will get huge bonuses for three to four years. Then leave to implement the same strategy elsewhere. Then they'll bring someone from another company in who has experience migrating from outsourcing to internal IT again. Like a 8 year cycle.
Perhaps the bonus should be after the fact. Just a thought.
While I'm a fan of more open borders and immigration it's cases like me that really makes me concerned that our immigration and offshore-worker systems are being abused by corporations from profit. 
I'm honestly asking because I'd like to understand this perspective:

What is it about this particular case that makes you worry about immigration/off-shore worker systems being "abused"?
Corporations finding an excuse to replace native citizen workers with cheap labor that costs people their livelihoods. That's my concern.
that's the whole reason why businesses want open borders and immigration. it's not abuse, it's working as intended.
Not really. They find loopholes in the system and often hire them by advertising outside the US in the first place.
Right, I guess that's why I'm confused.  What do you imagine corporations would do in an open-borders/immigration/off-shore friendly system?

I'm not even saying it doesn't make sense to support those things, but this case seems to be as straightforward and legitimate an application of those policies as you're likely to find.
Well corporations would take advantage of the cheap labor. While they're useful for jobs less and less Americans want to do I'm concerned about them competing against jobs Americans do want.


Would American workers be willing to do the jobs if the wages were higher?
The distinction is illusory: There is no "job that Americans will never want to do". There are some pretty unpleasant jobs out there that Americans want to do because of how well they pay. That's kind of the point:  jobs that are more unpleasant but don't pay enough to balance that out can't find anyone to hire and thus must raise their wages.

Bringing in foreign labor to push those wages down or bringing in foreign labor to keep them down in the first place (like the famous strawberry picking example) is pretty much the same thing).

I don't think anyone on either side of the debate finds this controversial. The disagreement is over whether the efficiency gained from trading off wages for lower costs is worth the net upward redistribution that it causes.
With the way UC is run, those who made this decision will bail or be promoted before having to deal with the consequences.  
Is it tata consulting? I wont even grace then with capitalizing their name.
Good, saves the taxpayers a few dollars. They weren't all that helpful when I had to talk to them anyways.
It's coming, guys. We better learn some real skills.
A glorious victory for the proletariat! Down with tech! Down with education! 
This is inevitable. No purpose in whining about it.
Good less techies in the city!

Meh, they're only outsourcing the grunt work, the actual innovation and heavy lifting stuff is still going to be done in-house. 

People have tried outsourcing the actual innovation in the past and found that it doesn't work as well as they would like it to. 
I've worked for a company that used HCL for just that and the experience was torturous.

&gt;Phase 2 includes:

&gt;- Remaining entrances at Powell and Civic Center Stations

&gt;- Phase 2 is funded

&gt;Phase 3 includes:
&gt;- All entrances at Embarcadero and Montgomery Stations

&gt;- Phase 3 is currently not funded

$60m for 27 entrances = $2.22m per entrance

&gt;The first phase of the project will be funded with $12M in Proposition B funds, which will be used for design and engineering as well as construction of the first three entrances.

&gt;The second phase will be jointly funded by $30M in Proposition A funds plus an additional $18M in funds from BART’s capital outlay budget, and will succeed in covering the remaining 24 Market Street entrances.
Shhh no we're supposed to be angry
Yeah, 40 years too late. I can't believe this took them 40 years to realize the mistake. 
Of all things to complain about regarding BART, seems like a waste of energy to complain about the things they're actually fixing already.
I think 12th St Station in Oakland isn't part of the renovation. 

There are still much work to be done. 
Yeah they don't have enough money for it, or a whole host of other modernization things that just make sense, but cost money they don't have. So you should vote for the bond if you want them to do this.
The whole host of "other modernization things" is kinda the problem.  What's to stop BART from using the money to spiffy up the parking garages?  To sink it into keeping the OAK people connector running?  What's to stop that money from going into cost overruns with the Warm Springs extension?
Yes that has crossed my mind. I will wait and see. I think it will be a last minute decision for me. I can't say yes or not right now. Both sides have merits. 
What's the other side of the argument? Defund bart in order to push the bay area into a transportation crisis so the rents may go down?
Who said defund? No one is arguing for defunding.
The time has already passed. What do you want them to do? Go back in time and fix it? Complaining now when it's in the process is being fixed is completely pointless. Seriously what do you gain from it?
$2m per sounds _insane_ 
Ehhh not really. You've got costly anchoring in an existing concrete sidewalk while keeping the sidewalk open. It's easy when you're greenfield but super difficult when you're retrofitting: people are using this stuff 24/7 and insurance, safety guards, and whatever else adds up fast. 
What does the result of those two million look like? That does seem very high. 
How would you estimate this work being done? I would like to see your proposal.
You'd think they'd prioritize Embarcadero and Montgomery since (and I'm assuming here..) they are the most utilized stations of the bunch (AT&amp;T Park, FiDi, touristy areas, closest to oakland, etc.)
Anecdotally Civic Center and Powell have the biggest issues with homelessness
You are correct. The Civic Center station is notorious for drug use and homelessness. It's crazy what I see everyday. 
Went into it Labor Day weekend to go to Oakland - OMFG, it was so disgusting.  Stench almost unbearable at the bottom of the NW entrance.
Bart just did this for the 19th street station. Built a big canopy over the entrance.
Shut the fuck up Donnie, you're our of your element!
Thanks for the link! 
BART is the only transit I have seen in the world that doesn't have a canopy over its escalator entrance/exits. Exposed outdoor escalator is prone to maintenance issues. Building a canopy will shield it from weather (rain, wind, snow, etc.), free-flowing trash debris and other things.

And yes, these have metal gates that can be closed at night so homeless people don't sleep or shit on them. Right now, the metal gates at most BART entrances/exits are at the base of the escalator so it doesn't protect the escalators at all. People are free to abuse or trash the escalator when the BART closes.
[They are already doing this](http://www.bart.gov/about/planning/sfentrances). Funding is secured for Civic Center and Powell. The rest is unfunded.

If only there was something you could vote for to make sure BART has enough money to do these things!
Really they just need canopy covers for the heavy downtown urban areas. That's where most of the problems occur. 
Those are the only places there are underground stations anyway.

Glen Park and Balboa Park already have covered entrances. So does Lake Merritt and North Berkeley. All that leaves is 24th, 16th, the Market Street stops, 12th St, 19th St., and Downtown Berkeley. Civic Center and Powell are already funded.
Even better would be if they did it like some other cities do, and put the entrances inside buildings where possible, so that you enter the system just as you'd enter a shop. Even less maintenance required.
Already the case for Powell Station. When Montgomery gets connected with the Transbay Center, would be a time to add some branches for that one as well.
Great, I wonder how much they have to overpay for them.

$2.2 million for a fucking canopy.  Brilliant.
It needs environmental impact study! 
Spoiler alert: no impact!
Wrong! It hinders the free movement of rain water. It violates natural order! It needs to go! 
This canopy creates a puddle from excess rainwater on my walk to work in the morning, which reverse-gentrified my neighborhood enough to make it affordabe, which in turn re-gentrified it, and it is now full of sightglass coffee shops and art galleries. Burn it to the damn ground. 
Positive impact because you don't have to keep expending the resources to needlessly replace escalators. Also, when escalators are working, it slightly boosts the appeal of taking public transit instead of a car.
&gt; If only there was something you could vote for to funnel more funds into the BART money pit and ensure that management isn't held in any way accountable for years for incompetence!

Fixed that for you.
BART is already obligated to pay set, non-negotiable salaries until 2021.

Starving them of funds is only going to punish the people who rely on the system. Management gets paid either way.
Are you referring to the labor agreement agreed to in May, which sets salaries for non-management employees?  What does that have to do with management salaries?
Management incompetence goes beyond their salaries.  Half a billion for an unreliable vanity cable car system?  How many millions for a bunch of freaking (standard gauge) diesel trains for e-BART?  How many millions were wasted on AATCS?  How much did their poorly trained cops and the Oscar Grant fiasco cost them?
I am on the fence on the bond measure. I just feel like most of that money is going to be used on wages and salaries again.. 
Bonds for capital improvements *have* to be spent on capital expenditures--the sort of thing outlined in the prospectus of the bond.  If they weren't, the bondholders would sue.  
Even if it _could_ be spent on salaries (which it can't), that's irrelvant.

BART already signed its labor contract. The term lasts until 2021.

Bond measure or no bond measure, they're going to be paying those salaries until 2021.

So even people who think the bond measure will "free up" capital improvement funds to be used instead on salaries are basically agreeing that not spending this bond money will just either starve the capital improvement funds, or kick the can down the road, because they have to pay those salaries regardless.
Not true for this measure. 

"Now General Manager Grace Crunican insists bond funds “would be legally bound to capital improvements and nothing else.” That’s only technically true.

Once the district receives the bond money, it can pull back operating funds previously promised for capital. In other words, bond money for capital improvements will essentially back-fill labor costs.

The district board deliberately left out of Measure RR provisions to prevent back-filling. As much as $1.2 billion, equal to one-third of the bonds, could offset operating costs instead of financing system improvements."

http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/09/13/editorial-reject-barts-3-5-billion-bond-measure-east-bay-times/

I will happily vote Yes if what you said is true but it's not. They can still use the money for labor costs. 
The devil's in the details.

Linked from that article is this:

http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/08/11/borenstein-bart-could-use-bonds-for-labor-costs/

&gt; That’s because BART’s financial forecasts assume it will continue its current practice of transferring about 16 percent of operations revenue to capital expenditures.

&gt;Here’s the kicker: District directors and staff refuse to commit to continue that full transfer. The ballot measure and other restrictions would bind them to only about $600 million. The remaining roughly $1.2 billion could be kept for operations.

&gt;That leaves more money to compensate workers, who already enjoy heavily subsidized pensions and health care coverage as part of a long list of sweetheart benefits.

Two things:  

1)  0% of BART's operating revenues should go to capital expenditures.  If BART were revenue neutral, or pulled a profit, it would make sense to reinvest some of those revenues into shoring up the system.  But it doesn't.  If you can't pay your power bill, you don't go around buying new light bulbs.  

2)  BART can't hire enough people to keep its system going which automatically discounts whining about salaries.  The number of people with railroad and mechanical experience is frighteningly small, and BART has to compete across the nation with other agencies for those workers.   
Most BART employees, by head count and by budget cost, are station agents and train operators. I have no problem with paying market rate to skilled mechanics and engineers. I have a very big problem when station agents and train operators, whom I consider unskilled labor given the specifics of their duties on BART, choose to hold our public infrastructure hostage the way they have done repeatedly, and rely on their union to not be kicked out and replaced.
How dare they make a living wage in the bay area? Do you think that some people deserve to be poor for not being born with an IQ enough to be an engineer and deserve less in life because of it? I'm curious why you think they make too much? Is it because we are used to devaluing labor and so many others make less that a non-skilled person who actually makes a living wage is making too much? It's BART's inept management that has kept this going on and the taxpayers who don't want to pay for improvements to the system to handle the much larger load of people, it's not that their employees make a living wage for the bay area.
I did not say that they make too much. BART employees chose to hold our public infrastructure hostage and fuck over all of us in pursuit of their wages. That behavior should be illegal, and government unions in general should be stripped of their ability to protect their members from competition.

I have no problem at all with unskilled workers making a good wage as long as they compete with other employees in an open job market.
Yes, but that doesn't prevent them from from cutting back on capital expenditures that came from other parts of the budget in response to getting this money in.

For example, if BART had already budgeted 2 billion over the next five years, and got this six billion that was mandated, they could cut that 2 billion down to 1 billion and effectively move 1 billion away from what the voters intended. 

There are ways to prevent this, but this bond measure didn't include any of those ways. I'll still vote for it, but I'm not naive enough to think it's all being spent on just improving bart.
Let's do an analogy.

Say you're shit broke and only have $100 but need $2000 for rent and $100 for electricity.

You've convinced the landlord and PG&amp;E to each take an installment. You'll pay them each $50 with a promise to pay more later.

Your friend hears about this, and decides to give you $2000 on the condition that it is _only_ supposed to be spent on rent.

So now you pay rent and repurpose the $50 that would've been a down payment on rent towards electricity to pay it all off.

Did your friend's money allow you to pay the electricity bill? Yes.

But did you disobey your friend's orders? No.
You forgot to add interest. Bonds are taxes with interest.
In the real life scenario, you're taking the $50 and giving it to your other friend who happens to be a lazy deadbeat (most Bart employees).
Not even a little, because that would imply BART has a choice not to pay the friend. They are obligated to pay the salaries.
Salaries yes - I have no issue with Bart paying those.  However, we have no assurance that they won't give management/employees ridiculous raises as they've done over the past several years.
Funny you think people who work 40 hours a week are lazy deadbeats. You might want to check your head for your really shitty bias. I have been treated poorly by one before but I don't attribute that to all of their laborers. And if you knew the shit they have to put up daily, I'm sure you would understand why they deserve a living wage.
Bond money can't be used for anything that isn't a capital improvement.

Detractors argue that giving them money for capital improvements will allow them to pull money out of their capital budget and reallocate it to salaries. Well, okay, but isn't that just an argument against giving them any money at all, regardless of the source? BART needs money to run.

Also there is no more salary negotiation [until 2021](https://www.bart.gov/news/articles/2016/news20160411). The contract is already ratified. BART has to pay their salaries and wages regardless of whether they get this funding. Denying them the funds will have literally 0 impact on that.

The only person that would feel "punished" by withholding this money is the rider.

You don't get to just say "BART - DO THIS!" without giving them money to do what you're asking them to do. It's part of our government. The government does what we pay them to do. They don't do things without funding.
"In a bait-and-switch scheme, as much as $1.2 billion from the BART bond measure on the November ballot could indirectly fund transit district labor costs.

BART officials claim the $3.5 billion measure would solely fund capital projects. But they have preserved the option to use about a third for essentially backfilling the district’s operations budget.

The operations budget pays the district’s excessive salary-and-benefit packages. BART forecasts that budget will be nearly $477 million short over the next decade.

In a telling statement, a district spokeswoman said in April that the shortfall would be eliminated if voters pass the November bond plan. Got that? A ballot measure for capital expenditures would fix a funding problem for ongoing operations.

That statement contradicted BART General Manager Grace Crunican’s public assurance about the same time that the bonds would not go toward personnel costs.

“The bond measure is about a capital reinvestment in the system,” she said as she announced the district’s latest labor deal. “None of that money can be used to pay the workers.”

It turns out that the wall between the district’s capital and operation budgets is porous. And the general manager’s bond program promise was disingenuous."

I just addressed this, did you overlook it?

&gt; Detractors argue that giving them money for capital improvements will allow them to pull money out of their capital budget and reallocate it to salaries. Well, okay, but isn't that just an argument against giving them any money at all, regardless of the source? BART needs money to run.

&gt; Also there is no more salary negotiation until 2021. The contract is already ratified. BART has to pay their salaries and wages regardless of whether they get this funding. Denying them the funds will have literally 0 impact on that.

They already signed the labor contract.

They have to pay.

Regardless of whether they get the money or not, they have to pay their salaries.

This means that denying them this fund will not affect whether or not they pay their salaries, it will only affect whether or not other things get funded. Like station canopies. Or track replacements. Or seismic retrofits.

The only person withholding funds will punish is the BART rider.
&gt;Bond money can't be used for anything that isn't a capital improvement.

That was your first sentence which turns out to be false. 
The rest of my comment explains why, false or not, it's completely irrelevant. Do you have a counterargument to that portion?
&gt; false or not, it's completely irrelevant.

Even if one generally supports BART and infrastructure spending*, the fact that what is being promoted as a $3.5 billion capital improvement bond might in fact be a $2.3 billion capital improvement + $1.2 billion labor cost bond is relevant.  Voters are being asked to fund BART through a new tax, and the fact that proponents of the measure have promoted it as "for capital improvements only" is itself evidence that voters care where the money goes.

You frame any such argument as "also an argument against giving BART any money at all from any source."  First, let's take that as true; so what?  In some ways this measure is a referendum on whether BART is well-managed enough to deserve additional funds, and the fact that it has locked up more funds for labor costs than it actually has allocated for labor costs is something voters might consider.

Second, one can easily imagine a funding measure that allocates new money for capital expenditures but comes with a condition that does not allow a reduction in the existing, status quo allocation for capital expenditure.  The East Bay Times editorial in fact makes exactly that complaint about the wording of Measure RR.  Concerns about the fungibility of money earmarked for infrastructure are therefore not an argument against any new funding for BART.

*As I do.
If your comment turns out to be false, what is there to argue about???

Going back to your comment:

I agree with you that labor needs to be paid. 

However, I don't like BART's misleading wording in the measure that gives them a loophole to use the bond measure for wages and salaries which directly contradicts what the BART leadership have been saying.

I don't have a problem rebuilding/upgrading infrastructure but with BART leadership's track record, I have my doubts and so do many people living around the Bay Area.

It is not as simple as vote yes and we have a better system. If the leadership and management can't change or improve, we are just burning money right now.  
If they get any money at all from anywhere they will have to do the same thing, because they need to pay the salaries they've agreed to pay. What argument are you making against this bond measure that is not also an argument against giving BART any money at all from any source?

You mean like these? Yes please!  http://i.imgur.com/w7h6BVf.jpg 
San Francisco needs something more utilitarian.  Escalators are breaking down due to human feces.  The entrances need to be secure all around.

http://www.buildingbutler.com/images/gallery/large/building-facades-7091-32827.jpg
Lol snow in the bay area 
I'm imagining someone dropping cocaine on the elevator and trying to imagine how that would cause damage.
[removed]
yawn
[removed]
You're not triggering anyone it's just a played out joke. 
Most escalators I've seen are behind the fate gate. That would decrease the amount of human waste in them, but unfortunately, downtown stations are poorly planned and it's too hard to implement. 
&gt; but unfortunately, downtown stations are poorly planned and it's too hard to implement.

Really? How so?
Every BART station in downtown is also a Muni station. If BART and Muni were operated by the same agency, they could implement single point of entry and place it at ground level. 

Separating BART and Muni entrances on ground level would have allowed moving escalators behind the fare gate. 
What transit system has fare gates at ground level, before escalators / stairs?  Boston, NYC, London, Paris - the ones with which I'm familiar all require descending (in older systems, to a sort of lobby where they used to sell tickets) *before* reaching the fare gates.
Vienna. Looks like this: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/U1_Praterstern_AG_Lassallestra%C3%9Fe_-_Walcherstra%C3%9Fe_01.jpg
Interesting.  Takes up a lot of surface ground, though.
That's the point though. They are intentionally doing it that way so you see the stations. Public transit has a huge role in Vienna. The new line they are building bow has even larger entrance buildings. http://cdn1.vienna.at/2015/07/u5_ja.jpg
You forgot DC. 
Wasn't trying for a comprehensive world-wide list, just examples of which I'm personally familiar.
Toronto's system has a lot of entrances in buildings.  The fare gates are in the building and then you descend   afterward the gate.
You get escalators?  Lucky.  Here in NYC, we only have stairs, and they are awesome in rain/snow.
I lived in Manhattan, it's fine walking up the stairs. 

The problem with escalators is when they are broken down, they block it so you can't use it like stairway.. So there are always long lines trying to get in and out of BART exits. 

At this point, we might as well have stairs since these escalators break down every other week. 
Not to mention the elevators are nearly always broken to, so what is the point of all the handicap accessibility if the stops aren't able to let someone in a wheelchair exit.
If I ever start a bay area punk band it's going to be called "elevator update".
Or perhaps they should just let people use broken escalators like stairs, as I've seen them do here in Manhattan.
"Escalators out of service, temporarily stairs."
"Sorry for the convenience."
Don't block the fire exit.
Blocked off stairs that you can't use. 
Vote for the bond. They want to do this and have a pilot at 19th in Oakland but all their improvement money right now is being burned on making sure their rails don't explode.
[They're working on it.](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/01/11/phil-matier-bart-board-approves-enclosed-canopies-stations-less-accessible-to-homeless/)
This is from January 2014...2.5 years later what's the status?
That article was in 2014... I haven't seen any development from it. 
Since that article the ones in Oakland have been upgraded to canopy style. It's really nice actually.
How do canopies prevent poop buildup?
&gt;  let's do that...but it's going to require a $500m bond measure, 3000 units of affordable housing, a 'camp, shit, and shoot up anywhere you want' law led by Jennifer Friedenbach, and about 10-12 years of environmental review. Also the Mission District Cultural Action committee is suing because transit escalator canopies are displacing families and mom/pop businesses.

You lock them at night so people have to defecate outside the system.
Sure let's do that...but it's going to require a $500m bond measure, 3000 units of affordable housing, a 'camp, shit, and shoot up anywhere you want' law led by Jennifer Friedenbach, and about 10-12 years of environmental review. Also the Mission District Cultural Action committee is suing because transit escalator canopies are  displacing families and mom/pop businesses. 
Make it $700m and you got yourself a deal.
Done! As a show of good will, I'll add in another $50m on top of that. Pleasure doing business with you with taxpayer money.
So much this.  This city has turned into such a pathetic shitshow.
Selfish progressive. These people call themselves selfless progressive but they are just using that image to promote their own selfish reasons. 
and half of that bond will go to bart management in the form of bonuses for passing the bond. 
BART should just give up on escalators and replace them with stairs at this point.
I honestly don't mind if they do this. 
I'd be in favor for the sole reason that it would stop the constant complaining in this sub about escalators. From this sub, you'd think taking the escalators WAS the public transportation. People completely forget that Bart gets you across a relatively large body of water in about 5 minutes.

When I get off Bart, I try to take the escalator if there's enough room to actually walk up it. If enough people are standing on the left side, I just take the stairs because I don't have time for that bullshit of standing on movable stairs while a machine slowly carries my ass up one story. It's not hard to walk up a flight of stairs, and whether or not I got to use the escalator on my morning commute is something I never even thought about until I started browsing this sub.

The level of complaining about ESCALTORS by abled-bodied people in this sub is honestly downright hilarious.
But we need the rain to wash away the piss. 
is there some reason we need escalators? just get rid of the shit-magnets 
Imagine - we could have escalators that ran for *days*. Maybe even a week someday.
At this point, you need some guerrilla tarp &amp; plastic tube attachment action.  $100 at home depot and going at 3am.
Wouldn't matter. The urine would kill the machine just as fast as the weather.
The homeless deserve to poo without being rained on.
The Taipei MRT is awesome! Probably the best system I've rode on (but I'm biased because I'm Taiwanese)

I think another way BART can enforce cleanliness is to have an actual fine amount for eating and drinking on trains. Even if it's only enforced once in a blue moon, having the actual dollar amount might deter more people from making the trains dirty
There are fines for eating/drinking.  It's a cultural thing that periodic enforcement won't fix.  Japan can get away with carpeted seats on their rail cars, and they allow eating/drinking.
Seoul is good too. 
Yeah, Seoul's system is definitely great too. I've also been on Singapore's, Hong Kong's and Tokyo's subways and they're all wonderful 
in tokyo at the moment and its absolutely mind blowing how much better their public transportation is than SF's.  it's amazing that SF considers itself to be a world-class city.  not - even - close SF
If you're taking a shit on the train, then you probably aren't worried about the fine.
Yup.  As others have noted, why in the name of god does it cost more than 2 million dollars to build a canopy? 
the future is now!
Oh wow. I lived immediately to the right of this MRT station in Tapei for a good year in a half. So weird to see it pop up here.  
This would require Muni and BART talking to each other in SF, which I don't think has occurred since they tore up Market Street 50 years ago.
We spend $200m+ on homeless, yet we can't afford to put a roof over the escalators. Just woah....
Dear asshole, get your company to pay its taxes.

And she's not dead.  Huh.  
Gutterpunk must have been angry because she couldn't find her way back to the McD at the end of Haight st.
There is a girl who lurks around that area that sells bud and kind of looks exactly look this one. Then again, there are a lot of people that look like this in that area. 
One time, a guy tried to sell me bud there as I crossed the crosswalk by the McD's and he wasn't paying attention to traffic, following me and he almost got hit by a car.  He then got pissed at *me* because he wasn't paying attention and almost got hit.

These people think they're a major tourist attraction, or something.  Can't wait until full legalization puts them out of business.
That's just a perfectly normal reaction for a narcissist, every time anything bad happens they immediately and intuitively find a way it's not their fault.

Edit: Also I don't think they'll go out of business, they'll just start selling other drugs or doing other crap.  Selling weed is just one way they can avoid having to get a job.  We need legalization, but it's not going to magically solve these people.
It'll solve some of them.  Less demand = less jobs.
I was crossing the street after meeting friends in the Haight for lunch one day and had a doggie bag with me. Some guy loitering at the corner around my age (20s at the time) asked for it and I said "no, sorry" or something to that effect. He then called me a bitch. Not sure if this has relevance to your anecdote but it made me think of it. Still get annoyed by it. 
&gt; Still get annoyed by it.

Sounds like a personal problem.
I had a guy trying to sell me weed on the onramp to the bay bridge. 
I usually say, 'no thanks dude, I'll just go to the store.' 
Their bud is always ridiculously overpriced. With the exception of once, where I got nearly 3 grams of hash for 25 dollars during a picnic on Hippie Hill, I've never seen or heard a good deal touted in Golden Gate Park.

Usually, they'll try to sell their 'fire' (and no matter what you ask them, the quality is ALWAYS *'fire'*) to unsuspecting tourists for 60-70/eighth of some generic beaster crap who otherwise don't know anyone local and don't have a cannabis card to buy with. It's funny when you tell them what a rip off it is, because then they start giving you the full-sales pitch on what a 'tourist' you are (I may have a foreign accent, but I've been living in this city for almost a decade now, when they're probably from some bumfuck state out in the mid-west) and how 'everyone else is charging the same price', when in fact it is only the GGP bud cartel (seriously, why do they all charge the exact same price, do they convene a meeting to discuss monopoly or something?) that has such high prices. 
They do as a A victim of gentrification I stayed a month in that god forsaken park. There are three gangs the Pirates, the SF scumfucks, and the dogs. They will basically harass any traveling kid who come through the park. Who might be a kind person who sells weed on the cheap. They will intimate said traveling kid, but even traveling kids learn quickly fuck the scummy peeps who live GG park. That being said some folks have a heart who are stuck in that park, but other are murderers.  
&gt; as a A victim of gentrification I stayed a month in that god forsaken park.

If you don't mind me asking, how did you lose your home?
I'm heard that it's controlled by criminal elements and you can get the shit beat out of you for dealing independently.

At least that's what the homeless dude I was buying acid off of said. Regardless, the weed is a rip.
Oh man I wouldn't ever trust acid from a homeless guy.
The true reason we need to legalize.

I want to purchase my weed at a Starbucks.
But you can already purchase it at McDonalds!
I don't smoke anymore, but I'm curious, what's a good price for an eighth these days?
$50-60 for top-shelf in Oakland/Berkeley dispensaries. Prices go down with quality to around $35.
Just check out SF dispensary menus online for prices.

https://www.thegreencross.org is one of them.
Oh cool, thanks. Didn't realize there were that many varieties!
I'd never pay more than 35 for a decent 1/8th of topshelf. People who can't be done just don't have the connections, but it exists--however, these days I exclusively smoke shatter, which I get for 20/g
Bullshit detected.
/u/Callooh_calais [ is basically the racist version of this guy](https://youtu.be/ulo6EC3It-E)
Its true. Barbary Coast sells shatter for 20/g. I have friends in Mendocino who hook it up with top shelf for 35. Its all who you know
OH I'm sure it is! I've only been asked while waiting for the 33 bus next to the McDs, but there are always several people out there saying "marijuana, marijuana!"

I have my cannabis card thankfully, and tbh, anything I've gotten from a dispensary has been far and away better than anything I've ever gotten from a street dealer. 
Much better than the times this dude tried to sell me meth in that parking lot.  It made me really consider if I look like the type that would be down for it.  I blame my old roommate and his late night McNugs cravings.
&gt;It made me really consider if I look like the type that would be down for it.

Maybe he was just a good salesman. You know those apocryphal stories about a man who goes to a Ferrari dealership and is ignored because he's poorly dressed, despite being unbelievably wealthy? Maybe it was like that in reverse. Sometimes the people who don't *look* like they want meth can end up being the best customers and he can't afford to ignore that.
This is actually true in the Midwest.  So many middle class house wives are getting pumped full of adderal for years at a time.  When the faucet turns off, they start to look for other alternatives, which usually means meth because of its abundance.
Maybe I should broaden my horizons and really go for that Ferrari! 
True, but there are quite a few girls who look like that, lurking around that area selling bud.

Oh my god, I've seen her on muni too. I thought she looked familiar. I just remembered that I saw her and her shitty friends on Muni Metro, with a dog that they had named something horrible like "shithead." She was repeatedly shoving the dog around, yelling its name. Just a horrible group of people.

How much do you wanna bet that she'll tell you that the techies are, like, the *real* problem with this city man?
I consider the GGP gutterpunks as just another facet of urban life along with cockroaches, bedbugs, and crime: They've been around so long, people don't even know where they originally came from, how they reproduce, etc.
&gt; Vera Rideout,

I always love when people's name IRL describe them. 


I think it's a fake name.  Her boyfriend has a name that is a misspelling of Quasimodo.
&gt; Her boyfriend has a name that is a misspelling of Quasimodo

He used the normal spelling until the real Quasimodo complained that he didn't want to get confused with some kind of freak.

What was your plan, lady? 
has a skateboard, but not a skater.
Giving mushrooms a bad rap. 
&gt;  "there was no rhyme or reason as to why this person wanted to strike the officer"

....

&gt; Rideout was booked for assault with a deadly weapon, threats against an officer and possession of a controlled substance, psychedelic mushrooms.
Those were my thoughts exactly
not to mention... cops have been pretty shitty lately in general... maybe they should stop, and other cops will stop getting hit on the head with skateboards. 
You're blaming shitty cops for this woman's choice to beat someone over the head with a skateboard?

More violence isn't going to make cops suddenly be more patient and understanding. If anything, violence against cops will just escalate them using force when dealing with people because of unprovoked attacks.

But sure, let's blame the cops for this burnout's lack of self control and poor life decisions.
Oh no... she should get reprimanded for it. 

But it's no wonder why someone would WANT to hit a cop over the head with a skateboard. 
And that's the difference between this person and someone who makes good decisions. If you have issues with the police, you don't negate your own credibility by doing something this stupid.

Who is going to make the changes necessary to lessen/stop police misbehavior? And are they going to listen to the concerned citizens peacefully protesting in front of city hall? Or are they going to listen to the police-assaulting skateboarder who is screaming "I'm going to fight you!" while carrying controlled substances on her person?
What an idiot.
This is why I'm always paranoid around some "street" skateboarders. I've seen "Kids". I know how dangerous skateboards can be in the wrong hands!
She's hot. I'd kiss her in the mouth. 
I lived in a transitional housing program ran by the non profit Larkin street youth services. I would  smoked weed in my room and sometimes   they would walk in for random inspections . They always warned me they would give me repercussions, but never really did much of anything. After a whole year of this I thought not much of this. Lots of folks were told this but nothing would happen. One day they told me after addressing the issue again. I would be ask to leave at that point. I was enrolled at city college and was fired from a shitty jobs at ace hardware a few weeks previously .  I got bedbugs from that employer when a family came in to buy insecticide. I think my housing kicked me out over that more so than the weed thing, but I don't think they could say that. I also think they did not dealing with an adult with untested aspergers. I slept in GG PARK FOR a month then that  Canadian girl got murdered and I decided to stay the fuck away from their. I went from thier to baker beach and wAs pretty isolated from other homeless folks which was nice. I then finished the semester some how passed my classes and went home for a month. Home was still pretty messed up so I came back out to San Francisco. Currently I am house at another non profit but i am better at working with folks now and  I have learned from my mistakes. 

Was runaway with aspergers got kicked out of my transitional living program was scared of the street folks of gg park. Slept in a remote area in backer beach after some got murder in Gg park by traveling gutter punks.
You're scum. Move out of the city or take yourself out. Drain on society 
Shoot her in the unwashed skull 
Yeah I kinda can see that, but I am living my life to the best of my ability. I also am respectful to others and at the most I am drain on your tax dollars, so could you please be a little nicer. 
I bet she's got hairy pits.
nothing wrong with that.
True, but it's gross.
do you shave your pits?
Your perineum is your leg's armpit. 
No, because no woman has ever wanted me to do that.
Gross bro
yea, not really, that's a pretty childish opinion
Does your lady let it grow long and wild then?
my gf grows out her pits, I love it 

fuck your gender expectations
Cool, do you also let her stick her dick in your ass?
I get it that you are a troll account with moments of unrefreshing, boneheaded agreement with many of my more nuanced posts, but really, it's childish. Your opinion is childish, and this response is childish. 

You're talking about something that is entirely natural phenomenon with literally no negative effects on anyone except normative expectations that our society has chosen, for the most part, arbitrarily. 

Now, i may have some controversial opinions with things about the culture here and there in san francisco, but allowing people to live the way they want to if they aren't harming themselves or others is absolutely admirable and makes san francisco stand out as a place of freedom. And you calling women who choose not to shave their bodies "gross" is exactly shaming people for literally no reason except expressing your desire for things to be done to make only you happy. 

It doesn't hurt you, it doesn't even affect you. It's also *totally fine* for you not to like it. It's another thing to set your subjective opinion as some sort of norm to make others self-conscience about they way they want to live. If theses women are trying to, say, go on a date with you, your opinion on the subject is valid, "you think it's gross." If however you are just encountering someone in the street who doesn't give a shit about you, "it's gross," is a pretty unsophisticated and childish thing to say.
really well thought out and articulated argument. 
Great argument! But he's right, it's still schnasty. Can't litigate Lady Underarm hair, the courts of public opinion decided this one loooong ago. 
It's almost like you didn't understand the argument you just complemented. 
You're too meta for me you edgy rascal ;) 
Independent of how scoofy falls on spectrum of thoughts-about-hair-belonging-to-another-person in relation to you, dismissing the argument as being "meta" seems a bit unfair without anything to argue the case of why it's "meta".. Also piques my curiosity about why you find it meta

The douchenugget who made such a ridiculous ass of himself he had to delete his account about a month ago after an endless stream of Crimegasm stories, vaguely racist shit, verbally attacking liberal supervisors and accusing people of being "pro-crime" then deleting his posts in shame?

 




I'm sure it's all just a crazy coincidence that mikkelsen deleted his account about a month ago and youaresecretariat created his at the same time. Just a big old crazy coincidence!

I've been accused of being like 3 different people in this sub...? Am I missing something here?  Are you guys really in such disbelief that multiple people disagree with the San Francisco hivemind?
Wow pretty defensive.  Actually, it's just the way that you are writing.


What part? The sarcasm? I'm just confused because people seem to think I'm an alt account lol.
The over the top sarcasm...more specifically suggesting giving medals/awards/honors to the criminal du jour.  In general the way you wrote the above post is pretty spot on for the stuff he would write multiple times a day on a daily basis.  Throw in something inflammatory about a supervisor and you are either madnessmikkelsen or his/her long lost twin.
I will say that I chose to go with extreme sarcasm after seeing a few other people doing it on this sub.  They seem to have cut back on it or even disappeared outright though - the guy you mentioned seems to have deleted his account.  So...I guess I'm the only one sticking with it for now.

Shrooms aren't so bad, our human ancestors ingested them and had spiritual experiences, which possibly culminated into the religions you see today
You left off ", Maaaannnn." at the end.

what am i suppose to see here? serious question. how is it sinking
This is the corner opposite the corner that is sinking. That metal corner apparently used to be flush with the ground.
Ah I see. That makes sense 
The picture in OP is incorrectly labeled.  The corner in this picture is clearly the location of the Bank of the West branch, the NW-most corner (Fremont and Mission), which is in fact the corner it is sinking towards according to http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/How-low-will-it-go-Millennium-Tower-s-troubles-9127889.php?t=abb4fbbd34
This is correct. There is also nothing visibly abnormal in the picture. The floating curtain wall was designed that way and basically looks the same as it did when it was built. You won't see any dramatic evidence of the sinking just by observing the building with the naked eye. As someone else explained in another thread, the building is basically taking the surrounding sidewalks and even streets with it as it sinks. 
If you go to the side of the building on Minna St. next to the new Transbay terminal you will see pretty clear evidence of movement.  You won't see sinking, but you will see large cracks filled and displacement of the sidewalk all along that alleyway.  
Yeah, sidewalk heaving and cracks totally make sense if you think of the sinking as a sort of gradual subsidence of the area around the building. Of course you can see that sort of thing all over even where giant skyscrapers aren't burrowing 16 inches into the earth.
holy shit, really? I can't math, but wouldn't that mean the top is off by way more than the few inches they claim?
Not really. I don't know exact values but I'm going to guess the tower is about 200' across and 600' tall. You can use similiar triangles and it will be 2"/200' = x/600'. Solving for x we can figure the top of the building is 6" over from the bottom. Not out of the acceptable deflection range for a tower of that height during a wind storm.  

Obviously this is a back of the envelope calculation and while the tower is sinking/leaning it's been evaluated by SGH, a world renown structural engineering firm, and they found there is no imminent risk of collapse. 
Right, so they're saying that it's only off by 2".
So what you're saying is some one is actually getting a better view? All upsides to me!
That assumes it is perfectly rigid and leans rather than deforming.
&gt;Obviously this is a back of the envelop calculation 

It's a rudimentary analysis and I'm not going to break out the finite element software for a reddit comment :)
Also, just looking at the picture [here](http://sfist.com/attachments/SFist_Jay/millennium-tower-new.jpg), it's definitely not a 3:1 (height to width) ratio. Just eyeballing, it looks more like 5 or even 6:1.
I'm curious how those inches are measured. Do you measure at the top or at the bottom or mid way? Where are those 2 inches of tilt measured?
No, take something like a shoe box and raise one vertex off the ground 1/4". The opposite vertex has only moved 1/4" as well.
 The taller the shoe box, the more horizontal movement of the top edge per unit of vertical movement of the bottom edge.
Yes, horizontal. Claims however have been made about the sinking, i.e. vertical movement and those would not be off by more than 1/4". My bad...

This is not the reason—a previous structural engineer and Redditor gave his assessment in a previously linked article. I can't remember the reason, but it's not "lack of drilling into bedrock."
That was me! Drilling to bedrock is a silly statement that nonengineers keep repeating without knowing what it means. The foundation is drilled into a dense sand layer that provides sufficient bearing to support the building but happens to be on top of old bay mud that is settling more than expect. Things don't always go as expected and it's unfortunate but the building isn't going to collapse. There will be a bunch of law suits and a retrofit, however there was no reason to design longer piles based on the Geotechnical report done by a reputable bay area firm. 
What is the expected retrofit?  I believe for the leaning tower in Pisa, they dug out some of the dirt from the side opposite the lean to counteract it some.  I could imagine that injecting concrete down deep might solidify the ground, but that seems like a crapshoot.  
There are a couple different methods that can be implemented but as far as I know everything is very preliminary at this stage. It will probably depend how the lawsuits pan out. 

As you said the could try lowering one side of the building or jacking up the other. Ground improvement through mixing concrete with the soil or adding more pile are other options. All have the potential to work but I can't comment on which would be the most appropriate as I don't know enough details. 
Who is suing who? Tenants suing the engineering firm? The builders? 
The builders suing all the new construction for Salesforce or the transit center?
[deleted]
So tenants pretty much going to sue every single one of them? 
I have heard the city may end up paying out.  Do you know if that is likely to be true?
So you could say the tenants are going to be the ones drilling to bedrock here.
drill to bedrock
I've got a friend that said the architects used concrete for the walls, when buildings that tall typically use steel beams which lightens the load on the foundation. Was he right?
Not really. Architects don't choose between concrete and steel based on the foundation. They are more concerned with aesthetics, flow of the building, layout, stair cases, etc. The architect will give the structural engineer a set of constraints on which to work and they figure those things out. For this building the architect wanted to use concrete.

Usually for buildings of this height steel is used because it's stronger, more ductile and ease of construction and a smaller footprint in the building. However, that doesn't mean that concrete isn't a valid choice, it's just not the first. 

So to answer your question, the building is designed with concrete instead of steel, but that doesn't inherently make it a bad design.
Just wanted to thank you for taking the time to keep everyone informed as best you can! 
I don't have any sources but I'm under the impression this is the real reason it is sinking. 

I took a tour of the transbay site a few years back and at the time they told us that the millennial tower was one of the heaviest structures on this side of the Mississippi, and posed quite a challenge when digging the pit for the trainbox. 

An unusually heavy building on a foundation designed to settle led to to extra settling. Add in the fact that they dug two giant pits immediately next to the building (Transbay train box and Salesforce tower foundation) and its easy to see how things could go wrong. 

If they had used a more conventional steel structural system or driven the piles down to the bedrock, we would probably not be seeing these issues. 
Here's what I've read on it: http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-s-landmark-tower-for-rich-and-famous-is-8896563.php

&gt; Unlike some downtown high-rises, the Millennium isn’t steel-framed. Instead, the developer chose a concrete design more common to residential buildings. It relies on huge columns, shear walls and beams, and it’s much heavier than steel. What’s more, the building is located on unstable mud-fill, just off the bay’s original shoreline.

&gt; The Millennium’s engineers anchored the building over a thick concrete slab with piles driven roughly 80 feet into dense sand. “To cut costs, Millennium did not drill piles to bedrock,” or 200 feet down, the transit center authority said in its statement. Had it done so, the agency said, “the tower would not be tilting today.”
Except that the side by the Transbay Terminal (former Transbay pit) is sinking *less*.  (So if anything, the shoring that they did digging the Transbay pit may have slowed sinking on that side.)
That would still count as an effect of the digging tho. Maybe the settling would be less pronounced and not be causing the rotation without the other construction. 

I guess we have to wait till things get to court to find out what really went wrong. 
But if the accrual characteristics of the mud later had been known, wouldn't they have done something differently? And wouldn't going through the mud to bedrock have been one way to prevent the problem?

You seem to have an idea of what's going on, can you comment on what this SF Chronicle article is saying: http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-s-landmark-tower-for-rich-and-famous-is-8896563.php

&gt; Unlike some downtown high-rises, the Millennium isn’t steel-framed. Instead, the developer chose a concrete design more common to residential buildings.

What the article is saying sounds correct.  Instead of using steel for (shear) walls, columns, and beams, it's using concrete.  Not necessarily the wrong choice of materials, it's heavy.


This is why it's so hard to make comments on buildings without looking at all of the calculations and the entire design holistically. Yes, a concrete building is heavier than a steel building. But that also means that they needed more piles to support the heavier weight, which means more support for the building.

Because it's a pile foundation, having a heavier building does not necessarily mean that it would settle more. 
So it's friction that's holding the building up?
Buoyancy.

Pablo Sandoval used to live there and I believe he was the cause of the tilt
They should move him back in but give him a condo on the other side of the building. 
Being a Red Sox fan, I would be happy if you guys take him back with his contract! He will save the tower after all.
Savage. 
Brutal 
Rekt
Is this thing going to literally fall over, or just look funny if you stare at it from the correct angle?
It's safe. It's settled more than expected but not disastrous. Mostly a debate between if the transbay excavation exacerbated the issue and the responsibility lays on them and in what degree or its all on the building owner. An additional seismic test is being done so well know for sure. 
Yeah with all that extra weight sitting on the Northeast corner I'm sure the failure of the pylons will slow over time rather than accelerate.
YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS.
Curious though--how are the other buildings in SOMA being built? Are they all built down to bedrock? Because the USGS [lists the whole SOMA area as being susceptible to liquefaction in an earthquake.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4MMahd01VxzONiHHzvNba3r7TRx80DBjg6tH71uQp1V6mwj7ClABqQriGvvw37VRWShJnwk2XIF1YTnoOAPbuYRW56GWKQRcSKw4-jdUDoZVVukdD4-ZeqGujbIow8PRn3k)
in time, it will be a huge tourist draw just like Pisa. I'm going to start taking forced perspective pictures of me holding it up before it's cool.
there is no way they would ever let it fall over. Look at the leaning tower of pisa, it leans extremely far and still does not fall over because they add weights and supports. There will be tons of work done to anchor the building and get it level again but it is going to be expensive. Any profit they made on this building they can kiss goodbye, they will be lucky if they dont end up at a net loss by the time repairs and retrofitting are done, plus all the lawsuits since this really lowers the value of the condos
It's likely the Transbay authority will have to pay for any damages and retrofitting. Values of the homes will certainly lower a bit due to the uncertainty.
Wait and see?

Yup.
I've no idea why I am being downvoted in the post above,u I thought as much, it would also explain why the area is so flat (and I am glad to see that my apartment isn't in an area with liquifaction!)
So is the Millenium Tower just built particularly shitty or should I be worrying about any property in SOMA?
The city never should have let the developers build such a large building by sending piles only 80' down into sand. 
The bedrock is 200' down; that's where the building should have been anchored.

That said, liquefaction is a bitch, and any building in the liquefaction zone is at a substantially increased risk of structural damage in a large earthquake. Newer buildings that are anchored in bedrock have a better chance of surviving unscathed, but Millennium Tower as an example, not every new building is so built. You should investigate any building individually and evaluate it against your personal tolerance for risk.

Me, I live in a wood building (flexible) on a mountain/hill in the haight (sturdy). 
I think you are correct. It's also a reason the huge quake of 1906 destroyed so many buildings. They were also built on the same landfill.
How does this happen?

Ground underneath is compressing. I believe i read it was built on a really old landfill.
Bribery and incompetence?
&gt; The foundation is drilled into a dense sand layer that provides sufficient bearing to support the building but happens to be on top of old bay mud that is settling more than expect.

See gulbronson's post.

&gt; The foundation is drilled into a dense sand layer that provides sufficient bearing to support the building

So negligence.
Meh.  I get the impression the work was done with a set of assumptions based on best available data and it turned out one assumption (how much this mud would compact) was wrong.

To me negligence is not even checking to see if mud will compact, or even if there is mud under the sand.
Curious how other buildings are/were built in SOMA. Or if Millennium Tower was just particularly bad. I know with the Salesforce tower they keep talking about the bedrock, but there are numerous other high rises in SOMA.
I keep hearing negative things about this. Why not look at the positive?

A new trap for tourists! Move over Leaning Tower of Pisa. Imagine tourists flocking to this building and standing around taking pictures.
The residents of Lombard Street will be so happy.
Is it the angle of the photo, or is the glass warped? 
Jam a crowbar in there and charge 5 bucks a tug. You'd make a mint.
Some settling is not that uncommon is houses. This is especially true of older houses built in the early 1900s before the use of piers and reinforced concrete foundations and especially houses built on clay soil.

Right, but there's no neighborhood called "downtown". I get it, people don't like the idea of names and things changing, but downtown is really just a word that identifies the densest core of the city. Right now we generally identify "downtown" as North Beach, Chinatown, and Financial District. I predict that that when construction is complete and the new parks, transit, and housing arrives we'll refer to that dense, northeastern part of SOMA as part of "downtown".

Is it still common to do the pledge in school? I remember doing it 30 years ago in grammar school but that was it. Or is Lake county in a retro bubble?
only in elementary school i've done it, that was 24 years ago.
I did it every morning at St Vincent de Paul growing up. That was from '96-'05. Not sure if the school does it anymore.
The pledge is so sick! 
I did all the way through high school. It's a good practice, as tepid as the pledge's language sounds. 
Yep, nothing says "FREEDOM" like forcing foreign exchange students to recite a pledge to the USA.

How is my statement a straw man? Often the sequence and contents of a routine are arbitrary. 

As for the non-sequitur point, the user didn't logically respond to my argument and instead merely restated his argument. I don't know if that meets the precise definition of a non-sequitur, but I think it's close enough for anyone who isn't an insufferable pedant.

When was the last time you said the pledge of allegiance? And has it effected how you feel towards your country? Or act as a citizen?
I haven't for decades, and it hasn't changed a thing.
&gt;When was the last time you said the pledge of allegiance?

Whenever I'm at an event where everyone else is doing it. The collective nature of the action gives it its true meaning.
vive la difference. 

I've always assumed group things like this are essentially a combination of
1: People just going through the motions (I would guess this is the majority) 
2: Just doing whatever everyone else is doing so they don't stand out
3: Shallowly Patriotic (all about the empty gestures, flag pins on the lapels etc, but no TRUE love of their community)
4: True nationalists who really do revere/worship their country and will defend it right or wrong.

ALL those behaviors make me uncomfortable to be around. Perhaps I am too neurotic. 
You're forgetting an important fifth category, made up largely of veterans and people who work with them or know any, or at least those who are properly educated:

5) People who unconditionally love their country, respect and honor the sacrifices that have allowed their flag to fly freely, and acknowledge their duties as Americans towards their countrymen.

Just a patriot who is perplexed and somewhat saddened by the hatred of all the edgelord leftists here towards loyalty to one's country.
thats quite the false equivalency you're basing your assumptions on
How does reciting the pledge teach you to love our flag or country? 
The purpose of the pledge is not to teach. It is to affirm your loyalty towards your countrymen. Seeing others demonstrate their loyalty shows solidarity and the united nature of our country. Some might go through the motions, but that's largely because many people don't take oaths seriously anymore, which is a shame.
You certainly can't expect a child to take an oath seriously either. It has no meaning to them without context - growing up and expecting kids to have this unquestionable fervent patriotism is kind of weird if you ask me but I guess it's similar to religious indoctrination children can get from their parents.
The purpose is to ingrain it into their routine by repetition. The teacher should explain the meaning to them as well. They also need to be taught that the pledge is an oath and should never be broken.
ISIS makes you take an oath if you miss them that much
"That man has principles, just like an Islamic terrorist! lololol"
the only groups that take oaths seriously in 2016 are authoritarian institutes, and you, apparently
If by authoritarian institutes you mean men of honor, then yes.
WTF?  I went through my Kaepernick phase in my US public school classroom around 8-10 and I never got punished.  It's free speech, people.
Unfortunately, free speech rights often end at the classroom door, in fact if not in law.
Teachers [can't legally require you](http://aclu-or.org/blog/students-not-required-participate-pledge-allegiance) to stand for the national anthem.
Yes, and if you have a teacher and the ACLU on your side, you might get to exercise that right.
They can't legally require you to **do anything** that doesn't lead to a distracting or dangerous environment.

This doesn't mean they can't dock points for participation, of course -- which is what's happening. It just means they don't have a legal right to prevent you from doing what you're doing.

The problem with not standing for the pledge of allegiance is that you are willfully neglecting what it is supposed to *mean*. It doesn't stand for America-As-It-Is, it stands for the values that the nation stands for and the sacrifices that have been made to ensure those values. By pledging allegiance to America you aren't pledging allegiance to everything happening in America right now, you are pledging allegiance to the rights and values that we try our best to have flourish here. You are pledging allegiance to really fucking bad ass **ideals**... and because we don't live in a utopia, many of these ideals took a long time to develop fully, and many more have a long way to go in developing fully. But, by refusing to pledge your allegiance for political reasons, you're only disrespecting all the people that have fought and protested and died and labored to strengthen the ideals we all love. 

If I were the teacher here, I don't know if I'd dock points. But I *would* request that they submit an essay explaining why they refuse to stand. I think that would be the best course of action.
You should never have to explain why you do not wish to pledge allegiance to anything.
It's deplorable but true.

I refuse to stand for the pledge because of the Iraq War and lack of rights for all people in the US (LGBTQIA etc). I started in 8th grade, but became 100% with it in 9th. 


I got in so much fucking trouble. I'd parrot the legal reason why I'm allowed to sit and read a book quietly rather than stand, and they'd say I must respect the country and stand even if I don't recite. Well, since they can't expel you for not standing, just yelling and maybe detention, I kept on at it. By the time I was in 10th people became use to it.


I really respect this type of silent protest and am happy to still continue it 12 years after I started. It doesn't do anything, but send a message that you feel there is an inequality in this country. It doesn't hurt anyone and frankly it's easy, just sit and read your book or stare at your desk or your chair at a sports game or wherever you are.


Only thing I stand for is for operas.
&gt;lack of rights for all people in the US (LGBTQIA etc).

LMAO. Go be gay in Saudi Arabia and let me know how that works out for you.

&gt;send a message that you feel there is an inequality in this country

The only message is sends is that you don't respect your countrymen or our war dead and you don't acknowledge your duties as an American citizen. That's why you got scolded. Your little act of protest just makes you look like an ungrateful asshole.
&gt;Go be gay in Saudi Arabia and let me know how that works out for you.

This doesn't make any sense. Did /u/7storiesup say that Saudi has a better track record for the LGBT community?

That's fine. Respect is earned by doing something respectable. Invading foreign countries is not something respectable.

Why do people hate America? Yet continue to take advantage of its benefits?
Why does it really matter if people say the pledge?
Because it's another thin veil for racism to hide under! If I don't like black people or believe that they are oppressed, I can question their patriotism!
Meet a veteran and ask him.
There are several in my family, including my father.
Jeez, that made me cringe to read. It's such a buzzphrase to say someone "hates America" whenever they offer any criticism of it, or in this case don't want to take part in a nationalistic ceremony. Our country was founded out of disgust and disagreement with the blind obedience required by England, and that's why our First Amendment allows for freedom of speech.

You're also talking about a kid here - teenagers tend to be angry about society and social circumstances and rebel. Particularly so against traditions, and the fact that many of us have to recite some loyalty pledge every day continues to be one of the stranger traditions of this nation; I'm sure you'd find it disturbing to see Russian children forced to pledge their loyalty daily or Iranian children pledging themselves to country and Allah every morning.

As for "tak[ing] advantage of its benefits", most of us, including this kid, live in our country of citizenship where we were born into. It's not something most of us have a lot of choice about, and unless someone immigrated I wouldn't really consider it "taking advantage" of the situation. It's the only option available in their life. Yes, most kids take some things for granted. But I don't really see how recital of the Pledge of Allegiance changes that in the way that draft dodging or tax evasion might.
One of these benefits that you perhaps didn't take advantage of is free public education, where you would have learned about US history and discovered that our country was built on the principles of freedom of speech and protest.
I can't tell if you are kidding or not.  At first I thought you were kidding and then I see these other comments and now I'm not sure.
Had to check the post history. They're serious. 
I think I found a video of him on YouTube:  http://youtu.be/6fZZqDJXOVg
Not everybody gets these benefits you speak. Life sucks for a lot of people because of their government, and very few of those people have the means to gain citizenship to a different country or, in many cases, even just simply leave the country. Many people who would love to leave are trapped here, probably far more than you would think.
Why do *you* hate America, by questioning the right of its citizens to exercise their rights? If you don't know what America stands for, please educate yourself before criticizing others.
He's questioning the patriotism of these students, not criticizing them for exercising their rights. Anybody has the right to wave a Nazi flag in front of a synagogue, but they shouldn't act shocked when people call them an asshole.

&gt;actively participating in something anyone in their right mind would find distasteful. 

Not standing for the pledge is something anyone in their right mind *ought* to find distasteful. Back in the day, you probably would have gotten a whooping by a still able bodied WWII vet.

&gt;Patriotism does not mean unconditional acceptance of country. It means unconditional love of one's country. You can love your country, but not support or approve of the things it does. 

Saying the pledge reflects that unconditional love. You're demonstrating loyalty to your country, not voting yes on war or something.

Your last sentence is juvenile and completely uncalled for.

[deleted]
&gt; Just outright say it -- you think that Black people are wrong and everything is just fine in this country. 

Lol.
&gt;No, not at all. I haven't said the pledge since the patriot act, which happened when I was around 14 years old. I am in my right mind. 

I am saddened by your lack of maturity, then. The actions of our government should in no way effect our enthusiasm to recite the Pledge.

&gt;Violence is the first and last recourse of a weak mind

Sometimes a good kick in the pants is what an unruly child needs to shape up. Doing something as immature as not standing for your nation's banner is one such instance.

&gt;No it doesn't. You don't get to tell me how I express love of country. Freedom of speech and expression are important freedoms bub. 

Not pledging loyalty to your fellow countrymen will not win you friends or respect. Especially not from those who bled and died for our flag.

&gt;I cannot believe the callousness, etc etc.

You're assuming an awful lot about me. I actually agree with most of the observations of BLM. I think they are doing themselves absolutely no favors by disrespecting the flag and rioting, though. 






Because other countries that are better actually have some protectionist policies to protect their people and jobs.  If I could hop on a boat or jump a fence there's a good 30 countries I would more than happily move to to escape this warmongering police state.
Because they share no nationalist sentiment. They sure do enjoy the benefits of a prosperous nation, but don't want to contribute. People are self entitled, and then there are those who believe they have a duty to their country
It's just patriotism signaling.  It doesn't contribute to the nation and is kind of silly that the US ever thought it needed something like a pledge to make people loyal.  This country kicks fucking ass and that's why people love it.  Places like China and the USSR have every reason to believe their citizens hate(d) them and want(ed) to leave, so they make a lot of these symbolic gestures mandatory.  The US is above it, in my mind.
&gt;patriotism signaling

Is that what autists are now calling "oaths"?

&gt;This country kicks fucking ass and that's why people love it.

Americans frequently take their liberties and prosperity for granted. It's nice to make them reaffirm their love of country now and then. Sort of like a child thanking their dad on Father's Day. 
"Make them reaffirm their love"
"Like a child thanking their dad"

Do you really think this is an appropriate or desired relationship between citizen and state?
Some people think Fascism really wasn't so bad. What do you want from them? "Yes, wild nationalism has led to some horrendous abuses"? You can't force a man to say other than what he believes to be true; It's un-American! 
It's not even a "thank you" to anyone.  It's not an oath.  It's reciting a poem. 

/If you want to be patriotic, go out and actually help the country.  Join the military.  Clean the streets.  Donate to causes.  Exercise your freedom of speech.
&gt;It's not an oath. It's reciting a poem.

Putting your hand over your heart and beginning a "poem" with "I pledge allegiance" sure sounds like an oath to me.

&gt;If you want to be patriotic, go out and actually help the country. Join the military. Clean the streets. Donate to causes. Exercise your freedom of speech.

Those are all great things to do, you're right. Freedom of speech is iffy though. A lot of the treasonous speech spewed by leftists and radicals can be quite harmful even if it's technically legal.


An oath to an inanimate object, instituted in schools because of the Cold War.  Learn some history.

And yes, using freedom of speech can be damaging in some ways, but it also helps people in oppressive regimes see how much freedom we have.  If I'm in Iran, watching a woman in the US wear "revealing" clothes and speak against her own government, I'm pretty impressed with the US.
&gt;An oath to an inanimate object, instituted in schools because of the Cold War. Learn some history.

"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS..."

Your history is wrong. The pledge has been around since the 1890's. The phrase "under God" was rightfully added in 1950's to contrast us with international communism in which the state was god. 
It was adopted by Congress in 1942.  Nice try.
It was adopted by Congress then, yes, but it had been around in various forms and used on a local basis for decades before that.

&gt;  Because they share no nationalist sentiment. They sure do enjoy the benefits of a prosperous nation, but don't want to contribute. 

Heckuva bait-and-switch, brownie.  The idea that "sharing nationalist sentiment" has anything to do with contributing to the prosperity of the nation is so stupid it's not even laughable.  Even if you decided you wanted to explore the correlation between the two, you'd be far more likely to find aggressively nationalist folks making the least contributions (most tax protests etc aren't coming out of "unpatriotic" places like SF, and when you look at contribution in terms of tax receipts it's absolutely no contest).

seems like there are a ton of cities with housing crises at the moment. SF, London, Vancouver just to name a few. anyone know why this is happening in so many places around the world?
Also historically low worldwide interest rates have investors seeking return from wherever they can find, incentivizing them to put money into real estate.... 
It's a combination of three factors:

* cultural move to cities, causing more people to enter these places

* quantitative easing, which increases asset prices by making them a relatively safer investment (if the government buys bad assets, the expected value of an asset goes up), and expansionary monetary policy more generally:

&gt;[In fact, one of the dirty little secrets of monetary policy is that it normally works through housing, with little direct impact on business investment.](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/notes-on-easy-money-and-inequality/?module=BlogPost-Title&amp;version=Blog%20Main&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;action=Click&amp;pgtype=Blogs&amp;region=Body)

* rise in the number of rich people in illiberal economies looking for a place to hide their wealth, first-world property market looks really nice considering the way we protect landowners. Historically this was mostly Latin Americans (such as Venezuelan rich people avoiding Chavez's regime by buying property in Miami) but now there are a lot of \*illionaires from East Asia, particularly China, who are in on the game

If it were *only* the cultural shift, the Case-Shiller index probably wouldn't get so high. Meanwhile, if it were primarily driven by speculation, the population of cities wouldn't keep increasing in spite of it all. Instead we're seeing an influx of both lambs to the slaughter and vultures at the dining table.
Another one is relatively low property tax rates.  BC has property tax rates under %1 on average.  The UK might as well not have property tax.  It's more of a flat-fee-ish council services tax.  And California has prop 13.
&gt;Another one is relatively low property tax rates. 

Absolutely. Totally neglected this. The biggest problem with the public perception of property tax is that it's a barrier to homeownership -- but by forcing properties to be used rather than held, it really preserves the system that makes homeownership possible for most people.
You forgot lack of new construction.  Restrictive zoning laws prevent an increase in supply.  This is an artificial "crisis".
Second this. 

This is the bottleneck issue that exacerbates all the others: 

population boom, renewed interest in urban living, economic policy, income inequality, etc... 

All funnel through the lack of new construction to allow/disallow the market to counter their effects. Let's build great things!
You also forgot doubling of the US population since 1950. We haven't built even close to enough housing for all the millennial adults we are about to have 
More and more people at a larger rate than anytime in history are moving towards cities especially costal cities. 

Reasons for coastal cities or large cities in general growing so fast are because white collar jobs are there with more people graduating with college degrees than before. 

Edit: For the people bellow disagreeing with me, [this is one report out of many that suggest this](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/world-urbanization-prospects-2014.html). This wasn't the report I was thinking about when I wrote my comment but I can't find the exact one I wanted. I had to read about all this when I was taking my urban economics class in College years ago. 
Suburban areas are actually growing more quickly than urban areas. At least in the U.S..
That makes sense if only because suburbs are a more realistic environment to raise a family in, they're often cheaper than cities, and many Americans still want to be homeowners someday even if millennials are more wary about the risks than their parents. 
I think it's more that it's still legal to build as much housing as people are willing to pay for in suburbs, while in cities like SF the amount of housing that's allowed is much more restricted.
I guess that makes sense, removed. I guess I was meaning that urban centers like Cleveland and Birmingham were once deemed unsafe or a no go zone, whereas now people are wanting to move downtown in both those cities. 

But suburbs growing still holds true to the fact of people flocking to cities, even if they eventually choose to live in the suburbs surrounding that city. 
Not just coastal cities. Denver and Austin are growing at a crazy rate.
Yea I agree, a lot of people are moving towards cities in general. I just had this stupid article from school in my mind when writing it saying that in some time in the future over 50% of the population will live in a coastal city, which is pretty crazy. 

But yea cities in general are growing at a crazy rate! I was planning on moving to Denver and was checking it out and it was nuts it had most of the same rental issues/ homeownership issues SF has. 
Also - and this is huge - building moratoriums or overly regulated building and zoning codes in newly flooded urban markets. If the market is not allowed to keep pace with demand via new construction, real estate prices are forced through the roof. 

This is an artificial crisis. We can fix this by allowing more construction. Taller construction. Market rate construction. Build what people are buying, and eventually the prices will come down.
Pretty much every city is coastal or on (a river or a) big body of water.

(for pedants)
Not really: Atlanta, Denver, Dallas, Paris, Berlin, Munich, ChengDu, Beijing, Mexico City to name a few off the top of my head. 
Most, if not all, of those are on large rivers.

Not true. NYC itself has more people than ever ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_New_York_City#Population)). I think you're thinking of Manhattan, which hasn't surpassed it's record population of 2.3 million it had in 1910 ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan#Demographics)). However, I think you can attribute that to two things. One being a huge percentage of land being taken up by offices rather than apartments. The other reason being the awful and cramped living conditions of NYC in the early 20th Century ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenement#New_York_City)). 
People were living eight to ten to a room back in the early 20th century in Manhattan. Think of the miserable cramped conditions of Chinatown, only it was basically the norm for huge swaths of the city back then.
[deleted]
We can only dream. I know of people speculating this will happen since '08.
London has blamed Russian and middle eastern money for their crunch, as it is moved out of those countries faster than ever. But so far no push to stop since its good for the system and those higher up in the system to have billions being injected.
From what I've been told that is adding to the problem is that there are tons of new Chinese millionaires and to protect their wealth, they will buy expensive properties outside of China and out of the reach of the Chinese govt and leave them vacant. This is in trying to explain why multi-million dollar homes are vacant in SF.
this is a far less part of the problem than you're assuming
Taxing vacant properties should still be part of the solution. Just like cracking down on year-round AirBNB rentals. Several small things add up to something significant.  
there are far more obvious solutions than infringing on the privacy of homeowners

... such as getting rid of archaic zoning laws and counter-progressive rent controls
Or Vancouver could do all three and further increase rental supply.
Right, and if we have a drought, we could both conserve water *and* deny it to people based on where they were born, thus doubling our success!
Monetary policy after the crash geared towards making housing more expensive.
Our society is reurbanizing. Millennials all want to live in the city for a number of reasons (cost of owning a car and house in the burbs is too much, more opportunities for fun stuff in the city, etc), and jobs are following them, causing even more people to want to live in the city. This is a sudden reversal of suburbanization that had been big from 1950-2010, and cities simply cannot keep up with the influxes, causing rent to soar due to limited supply. 

Speculation and hoarding by foreign billionaires doesn't help, of course. It's really out of control in Vancouver, BC and London, UK. And SF to a lesser degree.
Add Sydney to that list.  Zoning and NIMBY'ism are the primary reasons.  Younger people want to live in walkable urban environments.  Most of our housing development laws are based around sprawling suburbs (affordable housing is paid from taxes of new high density apartment buildings, with no requirement on new houses, etc).   
  
This has led to decades of under investment in high density housing near the core.  It ripples through all levels of society.  College grads without tech jobs, don't have a huge number of 1970's / 1980's affordable highrise apartments to choose from.  
  
Even today now we know this demand, new development is severely restricted in most housing bubble cities.  The costs (over and above land + construction) are so huge, that luxury is the only segment that is viable.  
  
Easiest way to house people is to let developers build high density housing for people.    Such a simple statement, but is still highly controversial.
I applaud this tax, if it turns out to work like the article describes, and think even the libertarians on this subreddit should consider it in line with their principles.

Vacant units create a negative externality on the surrounding neighborhood, and this tax corrects it. Far better than taxing foreign home buyers, which to me seems rooted in racism.
taxing foreign buyers is a good policy as well racists or not.
Do you also think we should have a special tax foreigners have to pay when they purchase BART rides? Giants tickets? Burritos? If not, why just real estate?
Well if Foreign speculators bought each and every Giants ticket and never attend a game and which in turn also denies other people from ever attending a game then I would say yeah, we should tax foreigners on Giants tickets.

Our RE market is like having the Giants play a game to a half empty stadium where ticket prices are out of reach of the average Joe who enjoys baseball due to said no-show ticket speculators.

Just think of the uproar if some billionaire from China bought all the access to BART and never used it, resulting in empty trains passing by you on your crowded commute to work? 
&gt; if Foreign speculators bought each and every Giants ticket and never attend a game 

But that wouldn't be analogous to our current real-estate situation. You seem to be under the impression that most of San Francisco's housing units are being held vacant by foreign speculators. What's your source for this notion?

&gt; Our RE market is like having the Giants play a game to a half empty stadium 

Do you truly believe that *half* the city's housing units are being held vacant by foreign speculators? It not, what do you think the actual proportion is?

&gt; Just think of the uproar if some billionaire from China bought all the access to BART and never used it

Wait, now it's *all* the supply, not just half?
the ratio of speculators isn't relative, this is a philosophical answer to your philosophical question.
How in the world would libertarians support this? It literally goes against their very core beliefs. If you said libertarians would support removing rent control and building restrictions then I would agree, but no way they would support an arbitrary tax that is effectively the government forcing you to do something or pay them money.

https://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianDebates/comments/16zpdg/how_do_libertarians_account_for_economic/

https://mises.org/library/what-externality


People not wanting to rent out property because the government forces them to keep tenants for life at below market rents is not an example of a negative externality.
Correct; the negative externality is that half-empty apartment buildings feel dead and soulless, vacant sidewalks are dangerous and prevent a vibrant neighborhood from forming, and unsupported local merchants go out of business. 
Well, if you don't like the aesthetics of a place you're welcome to buy the local buildings and decorate them as you please.
That's not how it works with externalities. Your pat response could equally be applied to the textbook externality example, a nightclub located in the middle of a residential neighborhood. "Don't like it? Buy the nightclub and shut it down." You'll be hard-pressed to find many libertarian leaders who would support that position. 
I think every libertarian would support that position. Libertarians are against zoning laws.
You didn't actually read any of [these links](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/52wlzb/vancouver_tax_on_empty_homes_to_target_nearzero/d7o6i3s), did you?
I feel chastened. That being said, I doubt any of those authors would still agree with you. My guess is that they would say that the city government of San Francisco by preventing building and limiting the rights of owners by promoting affordable housing and tenants rights have artificially changed the market leading to these owners deciding that the most economic sense comes from leaving the house vacant. I would guess they would want to solve this not by taxing these owners further, but instead by making it easier to charge what they want and evict tenants.
And your line of reasoning could be applied to the fact that I'm annoyed by people who wear fedoras. "They're a blight on the whole neighborhood and they should pay for their selfish choices." 

I think we could all agree that creating air pollution is a negative externality that taxation can and should internalize. I think we can all agree that my fedora tax proposal is stupid. The idea of making property owners who leave buildings vacant is somewhere in the middle and there is room for genuine debate but I happen to think it falls much closer to fedoras than emissions.
Perhaps [the most influential book in urban planning history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities) has, as its central thesis, the point that neighboorhoods live or die based on their amount of bustling sidewalk activity. 
If the government can't force owners of vacant land to rent, then how do private citizen neighbors force the same owners to sell?
Make the owner an offer. Everyone will sell if you bid high enough. Of course, if forced to part with your own money to fix it, you may find that you don't care all that much if a building is "soulless."
Good reads and discussion in there. Thanks for providing those. As I said in another post, I think this is a case where the tax is the more drastic step you can take (and introducing additional government interference)  especially when there are other options that take even more government out and would fall more in line with one of the main goals of libertarians 
Well its basically saying if you don't want to let the free market work, then you are going to get taxed for impeding others. So just let your vaunted free-market ideals play out and stop being so stubborn or you will get taxed for it. Just a gentle encouragement to actually be a libertarian
Just saying free market in a sentence doesn't mean you are right. Free market means that owners have a right to do with their property as they please
Actually, free market means the free will of the market forces dictate what owners will do with their property. Not "as they please" which isanarchist/nihilist 
No you're wrong. Free is the operative word. 
Incorrect. Market is the operative word. You're just being delusional.
I think the only way to settle this now is with bare knuckle boxing
I think the 2 ideas I presented before (removing rent control and building restrictions) would actually support the free market more without inserting government interference into play. I get the thesis behind the tax, just thought that there were measures before taking that step (which I think is one of the more drastic steps they can take). 
I think there are indeed many methods of tackling the issue, but the key is that one must find an idea that is ideologically sound to one's own beliefs, but also crosses over into other ideologies. That's the spirit of compromise that gets things actually done in politics. I don't really know which ideology I would side with currently, but honestly anything that I can convince an opponent is a good idea, that I feel strongly about would be a win in my book
The barriers to getting a green card in canada is significantly less than the USA.  If you want to buy a house in vancouver to actually live in as an immigrant, then that is far more achievable than the USA. 
Sorry, I'm not seeing how this is in any way related to my comment. Could you clarify?
You say the foreign home buyers is racism, but it's more about wanting people who actually live in the houses.  If you want to live in canada and buy a house to live in there, the barriers to not be marked as a foreigner is far less than the USA.
You have got to be joking....
Which part are you skeptical about?
&gt;follows a separate measure by the province in July to impose a 15 percent tax on foreign buyers.

Love it. And if 5% of homes really are empty may this is a 2 factor hit against investment properties which were never to be lived in.
There are literally like 4 houses in a row near me that have all been recently remodeled and sit completely empty, no lights ever on in the evenings other than the occasion random person who shows up once in a while to check on them. Willing to bet they are all owned by the same family/individual are are just there to "store wealth".
and/or launder money into the US
Could be, and it's a good guess, but there are multiple other scenarios there....like if the city didn't issue the certificate of occupancy, or there's some litigation, or bankruptcy court problem.... it's all just a guess.
Well, that's one approach to the issue. 
It's interesting that Vancouver appears to be suffering from the same crisis as SF: booming city population and inadequate residential construction, mostly caused by zoning restrictions against density and powerful local opposition against development.  Instead of scapegoating a local industry, however, the scapegoat of choice is 'foreign investment'.  

I'm not adverse toward adjustments in the tax code to encourage full utilisation of realestate assets owned in a major city.  But the sort of numbers they're talking about (5% off market) are totally inline with a healthy rental market: e.g. some units are off market due to refurbishment, owner life changes, interim between renters, failed price negotiations, etc.  So, modifications to reduce foreign ownership (the thrust behind the recent spate of legislation) won't actually free up any apartments for rent, only reshuffle the deck in terms of which landlord's own them. (And perhaps not even that, as Canada is a relatively open, freemark economy offers multiple ways of skirting foreign ownership restrictions.) 

If anything the Vancouver anti-foreigner hysteria is greater than SF's anti-tech, and there's much less willingness to even acknowledge that under-construction of residential units might be the actual underlying cause of the housing shortage.  As bad as SF's crisis is there's at least a glimmer of hope that some politicians 'get it' and that citizen awareness is slowly building around the need for intelligent densification.

**Edit:** terminology  'off market' instead of vacant.

**Editx2** Rather than respond individually to responses claiming anecdotal observations refuting my claim or positing theories on why the behavior of Chinese investors are somehow inscrutable and bent on distorting Vancouver's housing supply I'll provide these facts in my OP

- in the last five years Vancouver has permitted the following number of net residential units, i.e. gross number of units built subtracted [by units demolished.](http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/statistics-on-construction-activity.aspx) The third column is the number of units that ultimately get built, assuming that 80% of those units permitted get built (a number considerably larger than SF)  


year | permitted | built (est.)
------|----|-----
2011 |  4000 | 3200
2012 |  4700 | 3800
2013 |  4700 | 3800
2014 |  5500 | 4400
2015 |  6600 | 5300
    

- Yet, based on the Vancouver's 20 year average of growing about 6.3% every 5 years, the city has been adding about 7500 residents every year.

- If we assume that most of those moving to the city are young adults with a high percentage of them single, then those numbers are obviously totally inadequate.  And being that there is a lag in permitting and actual construction and Vancouver has been ramping up the permitting process many of buildings permitted in 2014 &amp; 2015 have yet to come on-line.

There's no need to assume some conspiracy of Chinese millionaires. (or tech millionaires) 
[deleted]
My original post used vacant when I meant off-market, which I've corrected.  Vancouver is under-supplied in housing, i.e. there is not an abnormal number of residential units sitting off the market and vacancies are extremely low.  Even Vancouver's own statistics show that, which was the point of my post.  

Anecdotal information is always about condos sitting empty with the lights off, but the reality is that they are most often fully occupied.  Case in point: the condos on Folsom and 5th, completed 2 years ago have been the target of people claiming were bought up as 'investment properties'.  Yet I know as a fact that several units are used as 'hacker hostels' and overflow housing for the Arts Academy.  Which is to say not only are the units being occupied, but in fact many would say that they are over occupied.  The city of San Francisco *does* keep track of residential, rental zoned units that are kept off the market and there has been essentially no change in that over years and in the words of the planning department, the level of is congruent with a healthy rental market.

Are you saying that if Vancouver was building an excess number of residential rental units that prices would continue to climb indefinitely?  Even when apartment vacancy rates reach 10%?  20%? 50%?  Of course not.  That's silly.
&gt; 'foreign investment'.

'foreign investment' is caused by the domestic consumers and domestic monetary policy. 

US people and government has printed a lot of cash/bonds/IOU to trade for the products produced by Chinese. We can keep printing IOU without acknowledging the setback.

One day, the Chinese is going to cash in those IOU. And this is why they purchase some many real estate in western countries.

[Here's how it's happening in Miami.](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article69248462.html)
There is very little anti-foreigner hysteria and a lot of hard data in British Columbia that foreign money is having a huge impact on the housing market.  The provincial government only recently began collecting data on residential property purchases by overseas investors (people without citizenship or permanent residency in Canada), and more than 1 in 10 homes that sold in Vancouver over that period were sold to foreign investors.  In some nearby suburbs, the number was almost 1 in 5 homes.

http://www.news1130.com/2016/07/26/real-estate-transactions-metro-vancouver-foreign/
The only way that would change Vancouver's housing fundamentals is if those units were left unoccupied.  All evidence suggests that they are not. (even that presented in the article)

No intelligent landlord would allow a building to sit unoccupied as it attracts blight, lowers the value of the property and it basically passes up very high rental prices.  (Remember landlords are supposed to be money grubbing and looking to extract every last cent from their properties)
Most of the buyers from the PRC don't give a crap about rental income. 
The PRC is a dictatorship. If their inside man in the party falls out of favor, they can get all their property confiscated in an instant. All they're doing is hedging their bets against such event. 
&gt; Most of the buyers from the PRC don't give a crap about rental income.

That simply doesn't make sense.  There are an endless number of things that an investor trying to secure their money can invest in, and generated income, appreciation, risks are always factored against each other.  Do you have any evidence that Chinese investors are somehow different than any other foreign or domestic investor in the world?

The whole point of the tax, in fact, (which I approve of btw) is that Chinese investors are sensitive to generated income/(loss) since a vacancy tax is a form of negative income.
The are not doing it to invest.  They are doing it to get money out of China.

These people are not interested in being landlords or ROI.  They primarily want to get their money out of China and into a safe foreign asset.
Right but aren't rents just free money to them?  

I'm trying to imagine someone explaining that the money they socked away could get them an addition $2000 a month and these Chinese people saying, "No, I don't want more money, I just want a safe place to keep it!"

Except of course in Mandarin, or Cantonese. 
A lot of the people who are buying Vancouver real estate with overseas money have millions, tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars.

To people who are using real estate solely as a way to get money out of China, they are not concerned over missing out on $2,000 a month on rent.  And as someone else pointed out, renting units is an unnecessary risk in a place with strong rent control and tenant protections.  

We're talking about people who are spending millions, sometimes tens of millions of dollars on property sight unseen.  And in some cases, buying property for a 'student' relative to live in:

http://vancouversun.com/storyline/student-owns-31-1-million-point-grey-mansion

So rental returns are really the furthest thing from their mind.
They are primarily left unoccupied, and the massive increase in real estate prices has driven up rents as many people cannot afford to buy and are stuck renting (who otherwise would have bought).  It's not really debated in BC anymore, except among real estate developers who don't want the foreign money gravy train to stop.

I think you're missing a fundamental piece.  The foreign buyers are not landlords, they are foreign nationals trying to get their money out of their home country and into a safe asset that their government cannot seize.
There is no evidence whatsoever that Vancouver has an abnormally high number of uninhabited residential units.  In fact there is quite a bit of evidence that the number of uninhabited units is low given that: 1) the city and metropolitan area has grown briskly for the last several decades and construction has not kept pace. 2) vacancy rates, ordinarily an indicator of over-all  occupancy,  are quite low.  3) One thing everyone seems to be able to agree about is that there are more people in down-town Vancouver  4) No evidence, other than anecdotal, has been presented of a large number of uninhabited residential units and in fact the government seems to think that the rate is about 5%, which is well within the normal for any housing market.  Believing otherwise required special pleading based, in my opinion, on nativism and suspicion of Chinese in particular.

&gt; I think you're missing a fundamental piece. The foreign buyers are not landlords, they are foreign nationals trying to get their money out of their home country and into a safe asset that their government cannot seize.

No one has provided any proof that this is the case, and as I mentioned it's not rational behaviour.  Even if your object is asset protection, leaving a residential building unoccupied is a proven way to reduce the value of your building.  There are plenty of management companies that will be happy to manage your property for a small cut of the rent.  Even if it was all the rent, you'd still be better off.  Everything about the anti-foreign investment hysteria screams irrational nativism.
You are way out of your element on this discussion.  There's a ton of research you could do that would enlighten you as to how much foreign money has come into the Vancouver real estate market, the reason for it, and its effect on the cost of housing.  There are many neighbourhoods in Vancouver that have transitioned in only a few years from full of life to empty houses with overgrown yards, condo buildings with the majority of the units empty, and so on.  Nobody is dreaming this up to further some bizarre agenda, it's been so prominent that it's undeniable.  Along with Vancouver having the highest ratio of home price to rent and home price to income of any city in North America (shot-up astronomically in only a few years).

What part of 1 in 5 homes sold to a foreign investor in a *suburb* of Vancouver did you miss?  That's official provincial data, not some conjecture or hysteria.

Interesting that I'm out of my element, and yet your the one contradicting BC's own research, including the links that you [dumped into a previous comment.](http://www.vancouversun.com/business/affordability/more+than+vancouver+condos+empty/11770403/story.html)


&gt; Vancouver’s soaring single-family home prices have been blamed in part on foreigners snapping up investment properties and leaving them empty.
 
&gt; That myth was dispelled by results of a study released by the city Tuesday that shows only one per cent of single-family homes are vacant.

Reiterating: there's no evidence of large numbers of foreign investment properties being left vacant by Chinese investors.  There is a great deal of evidence of chronic under-construction of residential units giving Vancouver's robust population growth.  Even in spite of the fact that uninhabited off-market residential building are not the source of Vancouver's housing problem a vacancy tax is still a good thing.
I'm not debating whether foreign investors are leaving properties vacant.  It's clear that there are many unoccupied condos in Vancouver, and it's clear there are many properties owned by foreign nationals who purchases them not to live in, but to get money out of their native country/currency and into a foreign asset.

And when the average Vancouver resident struggles to afford housing, let alone purchase property, it's absurd to think that people who earn income and pay taxes in Vancouver are the ones buying condos and leaving them empty.  The median household income for a family in British Columbia is [$76,770 a year](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/famil108a-eng.htm) and the benchmark property price for all of Greater Vancouver is [$933,100](http://www.rebgv.org/home-price-index?region=Greater+Vancouver&amp;type=all&amp;date=2016-08-01).  
I don't know anything about Vancouver's housing market one way or the other, but do you have links to sources for those claims?

Out here, I see a ton of anecdotal claims about empty houses and Chinese ghost buyers, but very little reliable data.

Sorry for the info dump, but it's not all combined into one place.  There is info above on how almost a billion dollars a month comes from China into BC real estate.  Over 1 in 10 buyers of Vancouver homes is a foreign investor.  Almost 1 in 5 buyers in Burnaby and Richmond (two nearby suburbs).  As well as info on the federal investor immigrant program that sold permanent residency to foreign millionaires in exchange for an $800K loan, and over 100,000 of those investor immigrants came to BC and most live and own property in Vancouver - a city of approximately 600,000 people.  There is also a report that shows what reported incomes correspond to some of the wealthiest neighborhoods, where many households in $2Million+ homes declare poverty level income.
Uhm.... From one of the articles:

&gt; Vancouver’s soaring single-family home prices have been blamed in part on foreigners snapping up investment properties and leaving them empty. 

&gt; That myth was dispelled by results of a study released by the city Tuesday that shows only one per cent of single-family homes are vacant.

My point.  

Did you just search for a bunch of headlines and dump them in reddit thinking that was proof?
Yeah there are a ton of contradictory and baseless statements out there on the housing market.  You have to do a very in-depth and thorough study and weed out throwaway statements that are not backed by facts, analysis, and research.  Also, the comparison of vacant single family homes to home prices is in no way relevant to the cost of single family homes being driven by the local economy or overseas money.  There are tens of thousands of single family homes in Metro Vancouver that were purchased with foreign money (not earned or taxed in the Canadian economy) but are not vacant.  Some are inhabited by students, and many are inhabited by the ~100,000 investor immigrants who came to Vancouver under the federal program or Quebec program.  So looking to see if a house is vacant or not will not in any way relate to if the money used to buy it was earned in the local economy or is overseas.

SFU Professor Josh Gordon:

[“The point I want to make in the public debate is that a lot of the other things we are seeing right now – including speculation, fear of missing out, loans from the bank of Mom and Dad, all these different things that we are talking about in terms of driving prices – these are all in a sense knock-on effects of foreign money,” Prof. Gordon said.  “They are not independent causal factors; they are occurring as a result and in reaction to the foreign money that is flowing into the city.”](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/justin-trudeau-to-get-sobering-view-of-vancouvers-housing-market/article30498551/)

UBC Professor Tom Davidoff:

[Housing prices in Metro Vancouver have risen almost 37 per cent in the last year, which Davidoff characterized as unsustainable, and due largely to the combination of a weak Canadian dollar and an exodus of money from China for fear of instability. Davidoff said that, if demand were to weaken and foreign money stopped flooding in, he would expect to see a "correction" — that is, a collapse of housing prices — in the order of 25 to 50 per cent.](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/tax-zoning-reform-tom-davidoff-1.3640181)

There are always going to be dissenting opinions on any subject.  There are people who deny global warming or that the moon landing happened.  But overwhelmingly there is a clear consensus that foreign money has had a significant impact on the price of real estate in Vancouver.



Vancouver doesn't have 5% rental vacancy rate -- it has a **0.6%** rental vacancy rate.

For comparison, SF has around a 2.6% rental vacancy rate.

----

If you're getting some kind of "5%" figure from the article, that was either:

*  The intention of the tax being to get Vancouver's rental vacancy rate "*up to* 3-5%, from near zero today".

* The "about 5% of Vancouver homes" which are uninhabited year-round, and not on the rental market.
You're correct, the 3% - 5% number (from the article) was the number of units being kept off the market.  Not the vacancy rate, i.e. the number of units un-rented but on the market.  My point was that that's not an abnormally high number.  Changed in the OP.
Curious how limited real estate development in Vancouver is. For anyone who's been [downtown](http://thedva.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/false-creek-DSC_0381.jpg), one of my biggest observations was the sheer # of high rises of apartments and condos. No other city comes close whether its NYC, SF, etc. You see far more commercial high rises in general in most other cities or even mixed buildings, but in Vancouver, what shocked me was how many buildings were pretty much 100% housing. By the way the same trend seems to continue in some of the Vancouver suburbs like Metrotown. Practically all of the high rises are residential complexes. Only a few are hotels or commercial.

Maybe the bigger challenge they have is simply foreign investment. I was just there a few days ago and was trying to look up a few condos and apartments to see how much they cost by going to their website. All the sites had a fat link for their Chinese website.
How about fixing bad laws by *removing them* instead of passing laws on top of them as if they weren't wrongheaded and destructive in the first place?
Doing this in SF would be a classic case of creating a problem with laws and regulations and then trying to undo the problem with more laws and regulations. Maybe people would be more willing to rent out their properties if there wasn't such a great risk that they'd be stuck with a tenant for life, endowed with more rights than the owner.

Unintended consequences are a thing.
Wut? Now you're going after people who leave their homes empty? I can understand the tax on foreign investors but this is too much. 
It's not the first time government has levied a tax on something to discourage what it believes to contribute to a social ill. Take taxes on cigarettes for example. Empty houses, by not being utilized, puts that much more of a squeeze on the remaining housing stock.
Oh come on. The owner of the property has the right to decide whether or not he wants to rent it out. Are you seriously supportive of this tyrannical tax that penalizes a man for choosing to leave HIS property empty?

Might as well confiscate all private property and make it all state owned while you're at it. 
Give me a break - it's a pied a terre tax. This is nothing new. Homes function as a place to live. They serve a secondary purpose as an investment vehicle/asset/opportunity for speculation.

Sometimes people utilize housing so hard for its speculation function that it no longer is reasonably available to live in, and a community suffers. All this tax does is allow the community to  preferentially treat the use of a home as a residence as more desirable than using that home as an empty, value-holding shell.

And since you said "Might as well confiscate all property and make it all state owned while you're at it", a LOT of the people owning vacant homes in Vancouver are Chinese citizens who have started utilizing foreign property markets for speculation purposes precisely BECAUSE China doesn't really let you own Chinese land in fee simple absolute.
&gt;a LOT of the people owning vacant homes in Vancouver are Chinese citizens who have started utilizing foreign property markets for speculation purposes precisely BECAUSE China doesn't really let you own Chinese land in fee simple absolute.

I think it has a lot more to do with the prestige of owning foreign land. Almost as if to say "I'm so rich I can buy land from those uppity American gweilos and just leave it empty!"
No, it's exactly what /u/GailaMonster said. No one can truly invest in property in China, buying property there is more like leasing, so Chinese investors look to buy properties growing, constricted, foreign markets like Vancouver and San Francisco.
Listen, I said I don't have a problem with taxing foreign speculators or investors (of course, taxing the foreigners who live and work here is stupid). But there are plenty of valid cases where people may choose to leave their house unoccupied. To punish them for that is just tyrannical.
But "punishing" people for smoking or drinking soda is ok, and not tyrannical?
We already have a tax that punishes a person for even possessing a property. We call it a property tax. We have taxes that punish people for making money, an income tax.  In fact, it punishes people more for the crime of *gasp* making more money...

Taxes can serve many functions. Generating income for the government, serving to support one business at the expense of others (see tarriffs), and discouraging behavior that the government sees as a net social negative.


EDIT: Seems as though you're in favor of certain kinds of taxes that punish certain kinds of behaviors already...

&gt; I support this for the same reason I support taxes on cigarettes. It's an easy way to give the government money without hurting my finances in any way and by taxing idiots who still drink these crazily unhealthy sodas. 

[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/52ix80/the_soda_industry_deceptively_calling_prop_v_the/d7m1pug)
it's crazy_boyz... engagement in 'discussion' not advised.
Second.
Why, if you own a home that you're not using you're clearly wealthy enough to afford the tax for the externality you're producing. It's good economic policy. You don't HAVE to do anything, but if you choose to leave your property empty you have to pay the tax to account for the side effects.
They're just trying to stir up FUD, play on fears of food security, and  make unobservant voters afraid their food bills increasing.

Food bills won't go up for anybody not spending a lot of money on sugary drinks, and the tax (and cost of sodas) can be avoided completely by drinking from the tap for free.

Grrrrr....
There's some misrepresentation on the pro-V side as well.  Even the [city's economists](http://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/FileCenter/Documents/5492-140098_economic_impact_final.pdf) acknowledge the research that making soda more expensive [doesn't reduce obesity](http://news.wisc.edu/research-finds-soda-tax-does-little-to-decrease-obesity/), as people just seek the sugar in other parts of their diet.  

But the city reasons that with the additional money raised, they'll be able to fund programs that talk people into eating better and exercising more, and that will dent obesity in the long term.  Although they make estimates for how much money they'll take in, they offer no targets for actually reducing obesity or health care costs.

Unfortunately, even if you believe such programs would do what the city says, [Prop V doesn't fund any in particular](http://live.voterguide.sfelections.org/en/tax-distributing-sugar-sweetened-beverages).  The supervisors can spend the money on whatever they want.

So what are we left with?  A measure that's entirely about raising revenue for the city and promising no particular outcome, through a tax they acknowledge will hit "those with less than a high school education and those under the poverty line" hardest.
 
Thanks for this - I think this is the most cogent argument against Prop V I've heard. What do you think about the UC Berkeley study that suggests that people are consuming less sugar from soda and more water after the tax went into effect, and compared to a reference group in San Francisco? ([Summary from LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-soda-tax-works-20160823-snap-story.html))

Here, it appears that only 20% of the tax is passed through to customers. Interesting.
([Study from Cornell](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/08/study-berkeley-soda-tax-falls-flat))

I don't like the regressive nature of the tax, but I think it could be a tool for better health outcomes. Think like the cigarette tax.


The fact that it's assessed on the wholesale level is an attempt to make it more effective and less regressive.  The idea is that it'll encourage stores to stock fewer sugary beverages unless demand accommodates the higher cost pretty quickly
From an economic perspective, in the medium term, it doesn't matter whether you level the tax on the consumer or the retailer or the distributer: the consumer will pay the same total amount, and each business along the way will earn the same amount of revenue.

The only difference is that if you tax distributors it makes the tax hidden, and thus more politically palatable.
&gt;  people are consuming less sugar and more water after the tax went into effect

It doesn't look like that's quite what the study says.  They found people drank less sugar *in soda*, but they didn't look at overall sugar intake or calorie consumption.
You are right - I was imprecise. I will correct.
I mean, I'm literally drinking a milkshake right now,  sooo
&gt; But the city reasons that with the additional money raised, they'll be able to fund programs that talk people into eating better and exercising more, and that will dent obesity in the long term. 

I doubt much money will be left over after it flows through the City. The collected money will go into the General Fund. Good luck trying to get anything out of that.
What do you think is the best way to reduce people's consumption of sugar?
Good question. I can't even fix my own sweet tooth. Taxing it doesn't seem to help. :-) 
First they came for the Soda, and I did not speak out—Because I was not a Soda drinker.

Then they came for the Red Meats, and I did not speak out—Because I was not a meat eater.

Then they came for the Pizza, and I did not speak out—Because I was not an Italian.

Then they came for miso soup—and there was no one left to speak for me.
Who fucking cares? Why do you care about what others eat so much?
Related anecdote:  I recently volunteered to give cholesterol testing to a group of predominately African Americans in the Bayview outside of a local BBQ food festival.  Every single person I talked to needed absolutely no help at all with cholesterol testing.  They tested their blood all of the time.  Every middle aged and elderly person had diabetes.  Eventually we gave up, closed up the booth, enjoyed some amazing BBQ.

Engaging in a poor diet for a long time really does cause damage.
undefined
Because it causes health problems in a large set of the population, and some people have empathy?
So your empathy leads you to taxing them?
Well, yeah, certainly, since our empathy also leads to us paying for the health consequences.
you also pay for welfare and small &amp; medium business loans and multitude of a million government services you will never use.  I guess you have the right to rule them all.
Yeah, it's called voting.
undefined
Ideally, my empathy leads to them consuming fewer goods that are physically harmful to them and having better health outcomes. 
undefined
Who fucking cares - well the point of the tax is to reduce the consumption of sugar by making healthier options more attractive, not increase tax receipts (there's WAY better ways the city can, and indeed does, do that already).

Seeing as we're being asked on whether this is a good way to achieve that, that's why I fucking care what others eat.

Anyway, they say don't feed the troll and you appear to have been fed too many sugary beverages yourself. Might want to have a glass of water and come off your sugar rush.
Why the fuck is being healthy any of the government's business?  Aren't we allowed to choose how we live our life?  Who are you to decide that I should weigh long-term health over short-term bliss?

Take this to the extreme...you are on the government's side that you shouldn't be allowed to do euthanasia for the elderly because "life" is more important.
The problem is you're missing the big picture. On a scale of one person, yes, we can all choose as healthy or unhealthy lifestyles as we please. But zoom way out and look at 1 million people (this is the perspective governments cooperate on). We can't view this many people without seeing the systems they interact with as well, such as health care. Health care is a system which the million people contribute to and interact with. If obesity increases, say 10% in 10 years, it puts a strain on the health care system the way supply and demand effects the economy. It is well documented that obesity raises ones likeliness for many diseases. Therefore; the fatter we are, the sicker we are. Being sick costs enormous amounts of money in this country. That money isn't always paid for through insurance: some of it is eaten by the hospitals, which makes costs rise more, which makes insurance costs rise. For the whole million people. 

So zoom back in to you. You many not see it directly, but the choices you make with your own health effect everyone around you on a small scale. The more people who decide to pee in the pool, the more polluted it gets. 
thank you for attempting to provide some rational argument to this idiot's post
That dude is trolling like a champion. 
I see the bigger picture. I don't think you do. You're working toward a government who's sole purpose is to control it's people and tell them what's right and wrong for their own benefit.
There are clearly different view points to consider here. It seems you're very afraid of big government. That makes some sense to me in the way you're painting it. But can you address my argument? Would you be ok with the entire country being obese? What percentage of the population dieing from preventable disease is acceptable to you? 
I'm fine with people making personal decisions and the outcome of those decisions.  If the country goes that way, then it goes that way.  Like I said, the government should educate as much as possible.  I have faith in humanity when they have all the information.  Unfortunately, a large majority of Americans are in crappy schools due to the government more worried about controlling everyone.  See $ spent on homeland security, war on drugs, etc
You seem to be conflating issues here. There's no escaping that society is, in many ways, one giant organism. You *will* be affected in a "everyone is free to do what the fuck they want"/psuedo-Libertarian society. That's the reason people are in favor of universal healthcare: it cost all of us more when poor people have only the ER to use. It's the same with schools. I don't have kids, so why should I care? (I felt this way for many years, in fact.) But today's kids will be tomorrow's tax base. If they're too fucking dumb to hold down good jobs or balance a budget (or a checkbook), you and I are going to suffer for it, as is everyone else. America has always prided itself on rugged individualism, but the reality is that we don't live in a vacuum. No man is an island, as they say. Being a part of society means that others' actions—especially on a large scale, such as a high percentage of obesity—affect you. No, we don't want to the government to control us. But "government" (especially in this case) is just a word we use to describe the things that we, as a society, decide we want to do. If San Franciscans vote that they want this tax, it's not "the government" controlling us. It's San Francisco deciding they want to spend a little more money to help prevent having to spend a whole lot more money farther down the road.

And as I said earlier, I do not favor this tax, because I don't think the data show it'll work. But if it's voted for, I certainly won't see it as "the government" trying to control us (never mind that Michael Bloomberg is funding the campaign in favor of it).

&gt; I have faith in humanity when they have all the information.

Unfortunately that approach has not worked in the past. A good example would be cigarettes. At this point just about everybody knows they are bad for you, yet despite this worldwide cigarette consumption is going up, led by countries that don't have regulations on smoking paired with cheap cigarette prices. In the US what has demonstrably worked is raising prices on cigarettes paired with bans on smoking in public places.

I think the problem is that the consumption is not so sensitive to small changes in price.  People aren't going to change their habits over a few cents really.  I think if they really wanted to modify consumption, they would need to drastically increase the soda price, but there's probably not much support for that.

Makes me mad it only applies to soda. Why doesn't this also apply to coffee shops selling sugary drinks like the junk you can buy at Starbucks? Some of those drinks are even worse than soda with regards to sugar content. 
Why just drinks? Why not donuts? Cheeseburgers? Ice cream cones?
People don't normally eat donuts, ice cream, etc for every meal and between meals.

A terrifying number of people consume soda/juice as their sole/main hydration source.

The whole focus on sugary beverages is based on the fact that people consume something with calories as if it had none
&gt; A terrifying number of people consume soda/juice as their sole/main hydration source

Mind telling everyone how high that number is for SF? Literally every single statistic being used to argue in favor of Prop V is in regards to the national population.
It *does*. The fact that you think it doesn't is a sign that the misleading advertising is working.

The full text of measure V is at http://sfgov.org/elections/file/3941.

It imposes a tax on "sugar sweetened beverages", defined as 'any Nonalcoholic Beverage intended for human consumption that contains added Caloric Sweetener and contains more than 25 calories per 12 fluid ounces of beverage, including but not limited to all drinks and beverages commonly referred to as "soda," "pop," "cola,'' a soft drinks." "sports drinks," "energy drinks.'' "sweetened ice teas." or any other similar names.', and it imposes a tax on 'powder', defined as ' any solid mixture, containing one or more Caloric Sweeteners as an ingredient, intended to be used in making, mixing, or compounding a Sugar-Sweetened Beverage by combining the Powder with one or more other ingredients. '

This clearly includes the mixtures used in creating high-sugar coffee beverages, even though those aren't explicitly called out by name.
The way I read it, coffee is exempt because under this shittily-written law, it would qualify as a "milk product":

&gt; "Milk Product" means: (a) any beverage whose principal ingredient by weight is natural liquid milk secreted by an animal. "Milk" includes natural milk concentrate and dehydrated natural milk, whether or not reconstituted: and (b) any plant-based substance or combination of substances in which (1) water and (2) grains, nuts, legumes, or seeds constitute the two greatest ingredients by volume. For purposes of this definition, "Milk Product" includes, but is not limited to, soy milk, almond milk, rice milk, coconut milk, hemp milk, oat milk, hazelnut milk, or flax milk;

Coffee beans are [actually seeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_bean), and coffee's two main ingredients are water and seeds of the coffee plant, so it definitely fits the legal definition of a "milk product" here. (Of course, you can also add milk or cream to coffee, but I doubt that adding milk would disqualify something as a milk product.)

I don't see how they could enforce this tax against coffee if it were challenged.
I agree with you, good sir. To add further fuel to the fire, shit like this would be exempt from the tax, despite having nearly as much added sugar as Coca-Cola:

http://cowwownow.com/flavors/fruity-trudy/

Or am I mistaken?
Seems like it would qualify. I might have to try some of that. I like that they've tried to keep it healthy by using organic *low-fat* milk.
That's a beautiful analysis!


This was my understanding as well the last time I looked at it, 

&gt; Effective January I, 2018, for the privilege of engaging in the business of making an initial Distribution within the City of a Bottled Sugar-Sweetened Beverage, Syrup, or Powder, ...

This includes those giant jugs of high fructose corn syrup sitting behind the counter at Starbucks. Another thing that a lot of people seem to miss is that this isn't a consumer tax but a distribution tax, essentially an import tax on sugary liquids into the city. A Starbucks store will pay $1.28 to the city when they take delivery of the gallon of syrup the same as Safeway will pay $1.44 to take delivery of the 12 pack of soda, it's up to them to decide if it's worth increasing the price of goods or eating the cost.

The good news is natural fruit juice is exempt and simple syrup is easy to make, so my bar tab is safe.

Because then yuppies would be affected instead of just telling poor people that their caloric vice is wrong.  
Oh fuck off. Not everything is 'us vs them'. Fucking pathetic. 
It's about making sure that the "yes" crowd is as big as possible by ignoring the caloric vices of many and focusing on sugary drinks such as soda.  By ignoring the cafe drinks, a whole group of people, who are consuming extra calories just as soda drinkers, are unaffected by the tax.  People whose line of thinking might go something like:

&gt; It's an easy way to give the government money without hurting my finances in any way and by taxing idiots

You expand the tax, and you'll find that it has more opponents, regardless of whether the health argument is valid or not.

It applies to any sugar-added beverages, and your nanny state politics can take my 40 oz double caramel frappucino with extra whip from my sugar-induced comatose hands, pal.
Yea, I mean, I'm not voting for it. Glad we focus on this instead of the massive crime, homeless, and housing issues. 
False dichotomy. We can focus on lots of things at the same time.  But I see what you mean, it seems trite in comparison.
I agree, we can. It just seems like the only things that get to a vote are very minor in comparison. 
There's a ton of other props on the ballot.

It doesn't just apply to soda. It also taxes juices and my favorite arizona ice teas.
The justification will eventually apply to sugary coffees, Twinkees, cookies, et cetera. It’s almost more accurate to call this measure the Soda-now-all-groceries-later tax.
How is that accurate?
How is it not accurate? The justification is that sugary drinks should be taxed because they make you fat. That reasoning applies to other sugary things, so why doesn't the same argument apply to those things too? Once the precedent is set, what is the logical justification for applying it only to certain unhealthy things and not other unhealthy things?
I'm asking how its accurate to call this Soda-now-all-groceries-later tax when there is no such proposal on the ballot. Imagining another law that doesn't exist only detracts from the discussion of the law we are actually voting on.
OK, I see your point. This is not a tax with a time bomb in it to have other taxes trigger later.

I do think it's a valid point that it might set a precedent, but the way it was phrased could be read both ways.
California tried to implement 'junk food' tax during Grey Davis's failed administration. It was a disaster with lobbyist lined up looking for exemptions. I used to work at a grocery store and the sheet explaining what is taxable food and what isn't was pages long. Some vitamins are not taxables, but some children's vitamins were taxable. Deli sandwiches not taxable unless you warmed them, so now its taxable. Its a fucking mess.

I wouldn't want a junk food tax, not because I don't think its a good idea but because the level of horse-trading and corruption it will invite would make Louisiana blush.

Is that like prop 5, or prop V? Also what is the difference between lettered and numbered props if the latter is true?

That is a bit deceptive, but what is the way they are defining sugary drinks? Like would a coconut water or orange juice count as it is natural sugar?
Prop V the letter, so this is the 21st local ballot proposition. Text of the measure is here: http://sfgov.org/elections/file/3941

I think it is drinks with added sugar, including sports beverages, explicitly excluding infant formula.

&gt; "Sugar-Sweetened Beverage" means any Nonalcoholic Beverage intended for human consumption that contains added Caloric Sweetener and contains more than 25 calories per 12 fluid ounces of beverage, including but not limited to all drinks and beverages commonly referred to as "soda," "pop," "cola,'' a soft drinks." "sports drinks," "energy drinks.'' "sweetened ice teas." or any other similar names. "Sugar-Sweetened Beverage" does not include:

&gt; (a) Any beverage sold for consumption by infants, which is commonly referred to as "infant formula" or "baby formula," or any product whose purpose is infant rehydration.

&gt; (b) Any Beverage for Medical Use.

&gt; (c) Any beverage designed as supplemental, meal replacement, or sole-source nutrition that includes proteins, carbohydrates, and multiple vitamins and minerals (this exclusion does not include beverages commonly referred to as "sports drinks," or any other similar names, which are defined as Sugar-Sweetened Beverages).

&gt; (d) Any Milk Product.

&gt; (e) Any beverage that contains solely 100% Natural Fruit Juice, Natural Vegetable Juice, or combined Natural Fruit Juice and Natural Vegetable Juice.

In terms of metabolic uptake lactose ≠ fructose ≠ sucrose.
The way this is written it does not include diet soda, which I am very happy about. I've been angry about this for months thinking soda tax would include diet soda, without looking it up. Thanks
it also doesn't include seltzer. :)

This is actually not proven. It sounds like a cop-out answer but it isn't.

Long term studies have absolutely not come to a conclusion on the effects of artificial sweeteners. People give them a lot of heat.

Do you know what works better than taxation to prevent kids from getting "f-ed up"? Having parental control.

Usually the numbered ones are CA state ballot measures and the lettered ones are SF city/county ones. 
Oh that is interesting, thanks for letting me know!
Well...it's not like you "need" juice. And natural sugar without fiber isn't any different than processed sugar without fiber. A glass of apple juice is nutritionally equivalent to a soda, except for a dose of vitamin c, which is very easily obtained through a variety of other whole fruits and vegetables.
Juice isn't not particularly healthy just because it comes from fruit, but apple juice is a particularly egregious example, as it function as a way for parents to feel better about feeding their kids the sugar they crave while pretending they are doing something healthy for their kids. It actually has **more sugar** than a coke or pepsi. Also, store bought apple juice taste terrible. 

OJ for all its sweetness has about half the sugar of a soda.

orange juice would not count as long as it's 100% juice and not some juice-and-something-else blend. See the definition of 'sugar-sweetened beverage' in http://sfgov.org/elections/sites/default/files/Documents/candidates/Sugary%20Legal%20Text.pdf.


I'm against sin taxes completely. Still deceptive to call it a grocery tax.
The difference here is most sin taxes are on very inelastic goods, tobacco, booze etc. Soda may be more price sensitive, and therefore the tax burden would fall primarily on the stores. 
It's not a sin tax if the money is needed to combat a health crisis that the products cause
My understanding is that a tax is still considered a "sin tax" as long as the primary goal is to protect people from themselves, so to speak — whereas a true [Pigovian tax](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax) is set such that new new cost accounts for the negative externalities of the thing being taxed. While this still reduces the activity being taxed, the aim of a Pigovian tax is an efficient market outcome, not harm reduction at the individual level.

I figure the soda tax isn't being set to include all the negative consequences of drinking soda into the price of the soda itself, rather it's being set at a level viewed as possibly-having-a-chance-of-passing. The fact that the revenue generated from the tax goes back into something related doesn't make it a Pigovian tax IMHO.
I learned something here today.  Thank you.  I was always pro sin tax for the reasons Pigovian Tax exists..  never heard it before don't hold it against me.
Yay, someone has actually heard of Pigovian taxing. I so wish this could be applied to automobile use by incorporating the actual cost of freeways, what's done to secure fossil fuels, and the cost of all the spoiled real estate in urban areas.

Speaking of taxes, I've wished for a long time you could control which government services your tax money goes to. Don't agree with the latest military campaign in a third world country or massive defense budget? Don't fund it.
So the difference between the two is the intent of the lawmakers? Isn't that splitting hairs? The point is whether the tax will have a positive outcome or not. Intent matters little to that. 
Sorry, I wasn't meaning to split hairs. Maybe it does fits the definition of a sin tax, or maybe it doesn't. after some googling, it seems that reasonable people [seem to disagree](http://oregonecon.blogspot.com/2010/06/soda-taxes-sin-taxes-or-pigovian-taxes.html?m=1).

Personally I think this stuff can be defined along a spectrum. Is it a pure "sin tax" that exists solely for the purpose of deterring that activity while stuffing the coffers of the city? Or is it a bonafide "Pigovian tax" whereby the "true" cost to society is factored into the price of the product? It probably doesn't fit the strict definition for either…so you're right, splitting hairs. But it makes interesting discussion (IMHO), and I think your blanket assertion that it's **not** a sin tax isn't necessarily correct either.
The root of that health crisis is poverty. The condescension is astounding.

America's job is to preserve personal freedom.  That freedom also includes choosing what you want to consume.  The government should educate you as to the consequences of those choices but that's about it.  

If you believe in healthcare for all, then it should be irrelevant each person's personal situation.  You provide healthcare.  It shouldn't be I provide healthcare and now get to dictate your life choices.
And consider Cigarettes, the primary reason I don't smoke cigarettes is due to advertising and PSA's I saw early in life, the taxes certainly don't provide an incentive to smoke, but the information was more persuasive. The same kinds of tactics can be applied to sugar, but it's cheaper and easier to just tax it and ad another "liberal merit badge" to SF's resume. 
I'm not even so sure the government should educate us about what is healthy.  In the past when they have done so, they have been wrong, corrupt, and generally untrustworthy.  The food pyramid, one of the biggest "consumption guidelines" in government history is thought to be wrong by a lot of people. 
There are limits to freedom realistically, I like the ideal of a free country, but when the actions of some impact the life of others we do something. Having a bunch of fat kids doesn't help us as a country. Having to pay for the healthcare of said day people doesn't help. I see your point but many people believe in limits to personal freedoms if it helps the general population out. And that help should have evidence, like lowered healthcare costs across the board.
People who ski put themselves at undue risk and put a greater burden on healthcare services compared to non-skiers. Clearly something must be done.
Can you show how much we spend on heart disease, lung cancer and related problems due to obesity vs the public impact of ski accidents?
undefined
Especially since 90% of the population are skiing once every two days or more
I'll be happy to support your position if you can demonstrate to me that skiers are statistically more likely to have an injury vs. the general population.

We have choice over our own bodies, and everyone knows what problems soda can cause.

The concept of a "public health crisis" over a personal choice is an underhanded way to tell people what to do with their bodies and us the real scariest thing about publicly-funded healthcare.
&gt; everyone knows what problems soda can cause

Sorry, you may believe you know the problems it can cause, but that does not mean that you should assume everyone has the same knowledge as you.
Elitist thinking at its finest.  We need to think we are smarter than others to believe we should rule them like kings.
Hate to say it buddy but some people *are* smarter than others.

The one mailer that really bothered me was the one a testimonial from a grocery store owner that they covered with pictures of fruits vegetables, strongly implying but never explicitly stating that they would also be taxed. Makes me want to vote yes just to spite these con artists.
I've gotten 3 flyers from the American Beverage Association-funded PAC against Prop V. The fear-mongering makes me want to vote for Prop V.
Only 3?  I've gotten at least 1 a week for the past few weeks times the 3 voters in my household.  High quality printouts too.
I know! I've even gotten a phone call already. Based on how many more anti-V flyers expect to throw away before the election, I think I'm voting yes out of pure spite.

Annoyed as well. I also wish the money would go elsewheres as what Philly did. Think it'd going to early childhood education, park and rec, libraries, community resources. While Healthcare is nice, support of the community as a whole instead of one sector is better. 
Its a really shitty tax. Based on completely unscientific bull shit.  And places like Berkeley have passed the cost onto other foods. 
How about we inject a little truth and call it the "your government thinks you're too stupid to handle your own affairs so it's going to institute a tax that is going to disproportionately affect the poor" tax?

If you have a look at obesity and diabetes rates, maybe you'll be persuaded that as a whole, people _are_ too stupid to make the right decisions about what they drink. 

Not saying the answer is a soda tax, but you're giving the populace too much credit. 
Why don't you go ahead and look at the obesity and diabetes rates for SF? There is a reason why the pro-Prop V side only cites national statistics.
undefined
The deceptive tactic is dismaying, but so are the other bad arguments mustered by the soda companies. Reminds me of the execrable arguments against same-gender marriage.
I believe it's because it's the concern of the grocery stores that the majority of the tax burden will fall on them. 
[When a City Passes a Soda Tax, Who Pays?
Taxes are levied against beverage distributors—but if the costs aren’t passed along to consumers, the policies don’t work.](http://www.alternet.org/food/when-city-passes-soda-tax-who-pays-video) 

TL;DR The price of what they're trying to ban doesn't go up but just ends up being rent seeking.
And that's exactly why Mexico implemented it differently...the tax is applied at bottling/distribution, not retail.

I am perfectly happy for this to be the point of debate in whether to pass this or not: whether the tax will be effective at changing the behaviors that it is targeting.

Mexico's approach seems to have been, though sugary drink sales rose last year after dropping for the prior two.
That would be an excellent idea if the tax is national but Oakland doesn't really have the ability to enforce a tax on bottlers not located in Alameda County.
We just had these same attacks for the soda tax that passed in Philly a few months ago. The "grocery tax" was used to completely mislead the poorer residents in the city to think that everything they buy will be more expensive. It was such a joke, they used the insecurities of these poor residents to encourage them to call city council and say that they were against the tax, even though the money is going to go directly to refurbishing rec centers, libraries, and school, all of which are incredibly underfunded here. (yeah I know, Philly is corrupt so it most likely won't be all the money, but any money that does go to fixing up these properties is better than nothing) They even had people on our subways trying to talk to everyone coming on the train to tell them how expensive all the groceries were going to be if the law passed. They wouldn't leave people alone, until at least one person signed their petition. It really made me glad the law passed.

Here's a few links to see how the soda lobby greatly mislead the city residents.

It is a grocery tax though - even the supporters of the tax admit that around 70% of the tax is being passed through to sugary drink sales and the other 30% is being applied to other grocery products. 

There is no law that says that retailers must charge a 1 cent per ounce tax to the end consumer, only that they pay such a tax on product sold. Thus, they can (and have) spread the cost out to other grocery products to lower the sting on their soda sales. 
This is what I thought was the case: there's no mandate on charging it for soda to the consumer at the point of sale. Grocers *will* attempt to spread that tax around all their inventory, raising the price of all goods. 
&gt;Grocers *will* attempt to spread that tax around all their inventory

Grocers *have* spread that tax around all their inventory. Soda is a trip driver. No retailer is going to allow the price to increase dramatically. 
There are a lot of things that are not healthy.  Should we tax everything that doesn't come from Whole Foods
I don't think OP is saying that the prop is right or wrong, just that calling it "grocery tax" is deceptive
The tax is clearly wrong. If you take the exact same scenario and try to add tax on something like birth control, just wait and see how angry the liberals get. 
How the fuck is anyone supposed to 'take the exact same scenario' and pigeon hole it into a tax on birth control? are you drunk?
undefined
I don't really understand what that has to do with my comment.
Whole Foods is already an idiot tax of sorts -- most of their stuff is overpriced
Tbh, I think whole foods is a great racket. If I were the CEO, I'd be pretty smug about taking advantage of hippies, suburban moms, and other groups afraid of agricultural science.
Amen.
Whole Foods is generally priced nearly identical to Safeway if you stick with store brand things. "Everyday 365" or whatever... Trader Joe's is cheaper then all of them though.
The secret is to go to ethnic markets.  Bananas for $0.49 per pound
maybe bananas is just a bad example, but I pay $0.79 a pound for bananas at whole foods, and i buy 2-3 pounds a week... It's not really worth it for me to take the bus or drive or uber/lyft across town to go to an ethnic market to save $0.30 a pound on bananas... 
I dunno, but Asian markets are cheaper in everything.  I'm Asian, so no other store sells the stuff I need for cooking.
undefined
Yup. Whole Foods rips people off on Pineapples too.... $4.99... safe way is $3.99 and TJ was $1.99 lol
undefined
Their produce is generally the same or even cheaper than Safeway. 
You know, I went and looked for Bartlett Pears as a price point and right now they're on sale at Whole Foods for basically the same price as Safeway's at $2/lbs, but normally Whole Foods is $3/lbs.  You're not necessarily wrong though -- it does come down to what is discounted and the price is close enough to call it a wash.
Not to mention higher quality and actually _in stock_. It seems to me like every time I go into the safeway their produce is almost completely picked over.
No, but we should tax things that are extremely unhealthy and cause more tax burdens in the future. We do it with tobacco and alcohol, so why not sugar. It is becoming clearer and clearer that sugar companies did close to as much of, if not the same amount, obfuscation about the health risks of their product as the tobacco industry did about the health risks of their product. And both industries knew they were lying.

It's called a sin tax and is pretty standard and agreed upon. We've just been duped for a long time that sugar isn't really bad for you, and therefore doesn't qualify for the sin tax. This view should be revisited.

edit: And soda has tons of sugar *and* caffeine. Talk about addictive...

edit 2: i also think starbucks  etc. should have to pay a tax on their sugary coffees, which are even worse for you than most sodas. Unfortunately that is not part of this bill.
The problem is in who gets to decide what is "extremely unhealthy." I can provide reams of studies that say a meat-free diet is much healthier, but I know plenty of non-vegetarians who wouldn't characterize meat as "extremely unhealthy." How about caffeine? Plenty of data to show it's either healthy or unhealthy, depending on the amount and context. Like most "sin taxes," a tax on soda is a slippery slope. 
Completely and utterly disagree.  You're giving the government power to dictate behavior.  It's not their role.  Their role is to educate the masses of the consequences of choices and then let them choose.
undefined
First of all, taxes dont fix anything, and the money collected rarely goes where they say it will


Secondly, by your logic we should be taxing bags of sugar too.  What else is going to stop somebody from baking cookies or brownies.   What about ice cream, I dont drink soda, but I do love ice cream.   If ice cream were heavily taxed I probably wouldnt eat it anymore because the burdon of paying more for it would make me realise how unhealthy it is.  



This proposition is intended to decrease obesity and diabetes among children.
1. Science doesn't support that it will work.  It is instead a tax on the poor.

2. Why make it a tax issue?  We should give people domain over their bodies for marijuana and alcohol but not nom-addictive soda?
undefined
To take it to a logical extreme, why not just tax people for being obese or having diabetes then?
The idea is to discourage behavior that promotes disease.
And isn't the most direct way to do that to tax people who get the disease?
No. The most direct way to use taxation to discourage behavior that promotes disease is to tax behavior that promotes disease.
And why do you want to discourage behaviors that lead to obesity?  It's to discourage obesity, therefore the most direct action is just to tax obesity itself.
Taxing obesity itself would decrease obesity by *indirectly* discouraging behaviors that promote obesity. It's *less* direct than taxing soda pop, because in order for your scheme to work each person must in their mind make the multi-step causal connection between the obesity tax and buying soda:

1. There's a tax on obesity.
2. I therefore want to avoid obesity.
3. I therefore want to avoid behavior that promotes obesity.
4. Drinking soda pop is behavior that promotes obesity.
5. I therefore shall drink less soda pop.
6. I therefore shall buy less soda pop.

Compare:

1. The price of soda pop has increased.
2. I therefore shall buy less soda pop.

Discouraging behaviors that promote obesity is a means, not an end.  The objective in taxing those behaviors is to reduce obesity, it's not a goal in of itself.

And even that aside, what about the hundreds of other behaviors that promote obesity?  Just tax obesity, indirectly affect all those behaviors at once, instead of piecemeal trying to pinpoint each one individually.
Why stop at children though. Taxing starbucks drinks could target adult obesity as well.

edit: and not disproportionately target poorer people like the soda tax

edit 2: I'm about 5 foot 6 and don't normally drink coffee or soda, but I do drink around 400mL of vodka a night, which is worse than all of that stuff. Better than I used to be where I drank about 400mL of vodka *and* smoked a pack of cigs a night. I still use nicotine lozenges though.

edit 3: when I did smoke, I always voted for more taxes on cigs. I fucking loved/love cigs, but I realized they were bad and causing problems and some extra taxes were ok to pay for the negative side effects.

I'm not saying we should shame people that use a lot of sugar (like how we shame smokers these days), but maybe we can make it less socially acceptable to eat a lot of sugar, just like how it is less and less socially acceptable to smoke cigs in public.

I don't think it's crazy to think that in 50 years we will view people that drink a big ol' 32oz soda everyday similarly to the way we view people that smoke a pack a day today. I mean like 50 years ago tour de france contestants would claim smoking cigs during the race helped them ride better. Things change. We learn. And we adjust accordingly.
&gt; Taxing starbucks drinks could target adult obesity as well.

Is that not the case? Prop V states all beverages over a certain limit of sugar. It lists soda as included, but not limited to. There are some exclusion (things like infant formula and whatnot).
Seems like only "pre bottled" drinks are applied to the tax. So Starbucks and other coffee shops that serve super super super super super suggary drinks are exempt. [https://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/10/29/heres-what-would-be-taxed-or-not-in-sf-berkeley-soda-tax-measures/](https://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/10/29/heres-what-would-be-taxed-or-not-in-sf-berkeley-soda-tax-measures/)

edit: Seems like BS to me. tax Starbucks and other coffee places on their sugar AND coffee. I'm sure Starbucks spends millions each year to congress to help make sure that doesn't happen.
That analysis by KQED is an analysis of a *different tax* under consideration in 2014.

This year's tax clearly does not exempt Starbucks and other coffee shops.

[a] it covers any 'nonhalcoholic beverage intended for human consumption that contains added caloric sweetener and contains more than 25 calories per 12 fluid ounces of beverage'

[b] it covers any 'liquid mixture, containing one of more caloric sweeteners as an ingredient, intended to be used, or actually used, in making, mixing, or compounding a sugar-sweetened beverage by combining the syrup with one or more other ingredients'

[c] it covers any 'solid mixture, containing one or more caloric sweeteners as an ingredient, intended to be used in making, mixing, or compounding a sugar-sweetened beverage by compounding the powder with one or more other ingredients'

See the full text of the law at http://sfgov.org/elections/sites/default/files/Documents/candidates/Sugary%20Legal%20Text.pdf, in particular the definitions on pages 5-6.

It is the case. Prop V will cover distribution of the syrups Starbucks uses to put into its beverages.
Let's not make the perfect the enemy of the good. Targeting children's health yields the biggest bang for the buck. Poor people will benefit most.
True. Fair enough. I'm drunk and was on a rant :)
Tax the frappucinos, sure, but coffee has negligible calories and supresses appetite.
Why not put a sin tax on caffeine? It's a very addictive substance. I'm not suggesting it, I'm just asking why it shouldn't have a tax like other addictive substances. Like weed is not only not taxed, but not even legal (in most places. I'm in SF and it is laughable how easy it is for me to get a weed rec), and there is much evidence that coffee is way more addictive than weed.

Just putting out hypotheticals here.
Why stop there? Tax everything! Keep digging deep enough and everything is bad for you.

so you want to start taxing cupcakes, donuts, candy, fast food because there are so many "bad" things i the world that makes you fat. Its rediculous to think that taxing soda is going to solve anything. Its just another way to make this city unbearably expensive while lining the pockets of city hall to spend on useless shit.
If you buy any of those things at a restaurant, its already taxed.
so are sodas. this bill is an additional tax.

You're doing the lord's work, SF. Instead of focusing on the lack of  housing, rampant homelessness and drug issues/crime (or the millions of other issues) that plague this city, you keep pedaling this nanny-state bullshit.
undefined
I was going to vote no but their campaign has been bombing me with mail ads and annoying YouTube ads... Now I am on the fence. 
What does that change about whether it is right or not? Are you just easily distracted?
I guess I will vote no then. 
Super annoying.  I know one of the guys that working on the soda tax and he said at the office there's a wall of shame with all these advertisements.  That being said, it's one of the best marketing strategies I have seen in a long time.
The Soda Industry wasting all of their efforts sending me (and my 2 registered voter roommates) flyers and spamming me with commercials when I could be watching another perfectly fine/stuck-in my-brain-forever Sleep Train ad both really annoy me.
Same with HH in Oakland. They've got a bunch of ads playing with local grocers talking about how people aren't going to be able to afford all the fresh, healthy shit that they sell when *none of that stuff is going to be affected by the tax*. Pisses me off. 

Also their logo is a balanced looking bag of groceries with a baguette and celery and shit sticking out of it, and a 2 liter casually next to it. 
I agree. 

I work in Berkeley where we already have the soda tax. I'll be honest, I didn't drink a lot of soda in the first place, and the tax here in Berkeley hasn't really deterred the small amount that I do drink. But, it's about establishing a beachhead against Big Soda. 

If I could wave a magic wand and ban soda from the entire Bay Area and put carrots and celery in vending machines in every school for free I'd do it. But that's not how these things work. 

This is establishing a beachhead to fight the influence of the soda and sugar industries and take baby steps towards a healthier industrial food system. 

And they know that. And that's why it scares the shit out of them. And that's why they're lying and calling it a grocery tax. 
The funny thing is that diet sodas (which are just as, if not more popular than their regular counterparts) are excluded from this tax. They will still get their money and retain their influence.
But isn't it a grocery tax? They don't have to charge the tax at the time in which they sell it so what's stopping grocers from spreading the tax around to all their inventory? 
Nothing, and they have done so. 
Praise on, Brother!
OP, can you explain how the price increase will only be localized to sugary products? From what I can tell, it is completely up to the merchant to decide how to recover  the extra cost.

Also, where is the incentive to not buy sugary drinks if you are already wealthy?
undefined
Fuck your taxes. NO.
This measure is so paternalistic it makes me livid. How dare they target poor people's behavior with a punitive tax. That is just wrong. The whole concept is that this tax targets poor people wallets.

Anyways, the only reason sugary drinks are so cheap is because of CORN SUBSIDIES. This means that basically we are paying taxes on something made intentionally cheap by government subsidized corn famers in Iowa. 

This is the definition of government hypocrisy. Don't tax it in Iowa so its cheap and people can afford to grow and sell it. Oh no its so cheap in San Francisco the poor are buying it. Let's tax it so poor people don't get it.
The inconsistency between tax financed corn subsidies vs. HFCS consumption tax is an interesting take on the topic that I hadn't thought of before.

Is your primary complaint that using taxes to try to shape behaviors is fundamentally wrong? And if so, is it because you think that it won't work, or because you believe that the affluent will be able to ignore the added costs, while the poor will not?
I would not say fundamentally wrong, because taxes always shape behavior. This tax however is literally sold as "make soda more expensive so fat poor people will buy something else and lose weight." 

The government already tells very poor people what to eat by what they choose to make available for EBT and I just find it troubling that now they are trying to tell the merely poor what to eat. This is all mostly white, mostly middle and upper class, do gooders telling largely minority people how to live there lives in a way that I'm not comfortable with. 

On the other hand, I am happy to stop flooding poor neighborhoods with unhealthy food that is made cheaper by government subsidies, and let people make good decisions for themselves.  
I guess I haven't seen the pro-V ads that are selling the measure as specifically targeting poor fat people...maybe I should broaden my media consumption to see those.  
If we *could* do this differently, and instead place it as an excise tax at the bottler or distributor, or perhaps even on sugars sold to the food processing industry, then it would more clearly target those "snack foods" in general, and lower the demand for them across the board. However, that would require a national mandate.
Voting yes on this one
Last time I checked, soda was part of my grocery list.
Wine and beer is on mine. I don't think anybody calling taxes on those a grocery tax would be taken seriously.
The industry's advertising around this issue is an outright lie, and that lie is making me want to vote in favor of the measure *even though* I think it's generally a regressive tax and therefore am inclined to object to it.


Yeah, there's been a big thread about it on r/Oakland with great info.
I have to admit that I look down my nose at any fancy four-color flyer that pops up in my mail.

And if another one reiterating the same information in a different manner shows up the next week, I become completely dismissive. That kind of advertising budget is generally cause for suspicion.

Eh, I feel like the author missed what people mean when they say "SF is losing its soul."  They mean that the city is bleeding low and middle income people.  This means people who just don't have a particularly marketable set of job skills to new immigrants to people who choose to live a lifestyle that doesn't jive with a 9-5.  

And...it's hard to deny that SF is losing that.  I mean, my grandpa owned a home and sent his kids to private schools on a machinist's salary.  Ya, SF is different- SI is no longer boys-only or blue-collar and HP's shipyards shut down. My dad was complaining about how the city was changing and pricing out people in the 90s. Most of the changes have been good overall.

But all this does have an effect.  You just can't be some bastion for the counter-culture when, in order to make it in the city, you need to be a skilled white collar worker working 40+ hours a week.  My aunt's a working artist and got her start working ~25 hours a week  and going to school and working on her art for the rest of the week.  That kind of lifestyle is just not sustainable in SF (and much of the Bay) anymore.

In terms of gentrification, the issue isn't that neighborhoods are changing, it's that there aren't really any affordable options anymore.  Plenty of people would happily trade more bars and restaurants for cheaper rent.  The reality is that when a place becomes so expensive that only people who are doing well financially can move in, it's going to change the culture, vibe, soul, whatever you call it of a place.  You can't just come to SF for whatever your reasons and be accepted anymore.  I mean, we're still pretty damn open when it comes to self-expression and all that, but you just have a lot fewer candidates when the prices are as high as they are.  Like...places like Lamorinda have no forced culture, but the price tags create their own; same thing is happening in SF.
You ended up falling into the same trap.  You said:
&gt; I feel like the author missed what people mean when they say "SF is losing its soul.

And then

&gt;  They mean that the city is bleeding low and middle income people. 

which is objectively true.  But then you go on to say:

&gt; The reality is that when a place becomes so expensive that only people who are doing well financially can move in, it's going to change the culture, vibe, soul, whatever you call it of a place.

Which is is what the author is trying to counter.

The problem is that no one is able to leave it at the first part: the extreme cost of housing in SF causes a lot of suffering for those who can't afford it.  So that when others point out that 'soul' is subjective and to them SF is just fine and as quirky and creative as it ever was suddenly the whole issue becomes one about taste, style and attitude.

Really the following comment from the comment section is the perfect rebuttal to the article:

&gt;&gt; "Gentrification may be a curse word, but it takes people with money to support the kind of food and drink we now take for granted."

&gt; What do you mean "we"? The lower and middle income people who used to live here don't live here anymore, that's what gentrification means. So while you may take the nice food for granted, "we" have been booted out of town because of it and are therefore not enjoying it at all.
I tell you, I love this city, and always will.  To even say that any city has a soul means a lot, and SF has one of the best.  So it's not for lack of love for this city that I have to leave.  It's because I'm not in my 20s and have a shitwad of money.
Same here. I am literally posting this reply from a suite in Denver as my wife and I explore the city as a potential location to move to. 

We love the bay, but with a 1 year old and a second on the way, it doesn't make sense for us financially anymore. We like nice things and the ability to travel. We need to buy a house for our family and I refuse to commute over an hour because the only thing we can afford reasonably is located in Livermore or something. 
Denver is already over, as are SF and Portland and Austin. I'm also looking for the next spot, just got back from Denver/Boulder last week. The gentrification is ridiculous (fancy apartments literally next to bars-on-windows row houses everywhere).  And I hear the tech scene is booming... 

Edit: I know I can always count on the downvotes in this sub.  Anyone care to engage on the content?  Downvote isn't disagree, right?  If I'm wrong, ELI5.
We like the Denver area, but not the city itself. I mean don't get me wrong, the city is fine.  What we like are the outer areas that offer good communities to raise my kids. 

We already visited Seattle and visit Portland next month. So far the Denver area is leading for what it offers families. 

I am just doing everything I can to stop my wife from saying she wants to move back to Miami to be near family. 
Call me crazy, man, but I think I'd rather live in Livermore than Denver or Miami. 
I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona!
Haha, well... if you're living in the suburbs either way then you might as well be in the suburbs of a city you love rather than a city you can take or leave, right?

If I live in Livermore, I can be in SF in 45 minutes. Even with a kid, I can hang out there every weekend. If I live in Denver, it's not so convenient. 
But realistically once you have a couple kids  settle into that lifestyle; living in the burbs, how often do you get to the city, and how often does the city you get to ABSOLUTELY matter (museum trips, sports arenas etc exist in all cities).
In which case the quality of the burb might become more important than the city is surrounds.

Livermore was a suburban hellhole with inland CA weather the last time I checked. Have things gotten better?
No idea, but the choice seems to be suburban hellhole with inland CA weather versus suburban hellhole with inland CO weather. Seems to be six of one and a half dozen of the other, except one's closer to SF. So I'll take that one.

And you could not pay me to live somewhere with tangible humidity.
&gt;inland CO weather

As opposed to coastal CO weather? At least Denver has a high altitude. And the heat there is dry (you have to go east of the Rockies to visit our nation's hallowed humid hellscapes).
Yeah the geography allows for better (well, more) sprawl, so the suburbs will last a bit longer since they're in far greater supply.  The traffic can still be pretty nasty though, if you'll be working in Denver proper.
I dunno man, I heard yurts were pretty big but I think I saw one too many at Burning Man and I'm kind of bummed on the whole idea of yurts.  Yurts are the new tiny houses that are just sooooo 2014 by now
Except for SF, all of those areas at least have affordable suburbs. They may not be as exciting as downtown, but at least you'll have a reasonable commute and enough space to live comfortably. Frankly, I've discovered I'm really more of a streetcar suburb kind of guy (having lived in downtown SF for about a year, which is a bit too noisy for my liking).

The next big place is gonna be Pittsburgh, I think. It's already gentrifying fast.
I agree that the reports of the city being soulless are ungrounded, but it's also okay to admit that it has changed and you can feel like it has lost something in the process.

A lot of art galleries and art shows have disappeared, along with the warehouse parties that happened when there was a lot of condemned / empty buildings that are now offices or construction. 

The Mission went through the regular process of gentrification, from impoverished neighborhood, to an artist hotspot, to now being a place of young professionals and families with artisanal shops. It's a normal process you see in a lot of urban centers and the general development means more building, housing, and higher quality (and cost) of living, but that doesn't mean you are ridiculous for having enjoyed what it was at one point in time.

I do miss my old bits of San Francisco. I won't fight to get it back or anything, that's silly -- it's the past. But it's also okay to say you dislike some of the change a changing city experiences. 
Yeah a lot of people can't grasp that it's ok to be accepting of change as a natural process in a city without necessarily approving of what that change brings. Do people get nostalgic? Sure. Does that mean they want to keep SF in the 90's? Probably not, but that shouldn't mean they need to blindly accept what SF has become as a "natural process". 
Haha, the grumbling's the same everywhere in the world. Check this out (it's about East London):

&gt; Artisan coffee. Pop-up shops. Bearded men in rolled up jeans, flouting the laws of comfort and hygiene to wear brogues without socks. The visual symbols of gentrification are as hackneyed as they are omnipresent in neighbourhoods in Britain that have seen the changes that come with hikes in house prices and rent costs.

But of course, back there people complain but we get pictures and paintings out of the whole thing. And in Berlin, artists paint over their works to prevent 'undead taxidermies of art'.

Meanwhile, a certain group of parochial San Franciscans sound like potheads who can only talk about the other times they got stoned. A bloody chorus of remember-whens, trying to turn the city into a theme park dedicated to their childhood.

I have no doubt that the city is nothing like it used to be back in the day. I also have no doubt that if it still were that way, I'd never know because I've transformed into a different person through grad school, more observer than participant in these things. And the observers never really know where the action is.
"Remember when is the lowest form of conversation"
As an SF native who lives in London, the whinging about gentrification in both cities is tedious and not constructive. And I am not rich, I make about the average wage in London and home ownership is looking a somewhat grim prospect, so it's not a situation of "Well, it's great because I'm doing great and can afford this £4 toast". 

Some things are better, some are worse. Gentrification has made other parts of the city interesting, growing up the Ingleside, Excelsior and Crocker-Amazon (all parts of the city I grew up in/have roots) were cultural wastelands. People thought you lived on Mars when you said you lived there. There are at least some interesting things to do around there now. Some things have closed, some things have been reinvigorated. There's more samey hipster bars but there's been yuppie samey stuff in SF as long as I've been alive. In the 90s it was coffeehouses and I never found those interesting either. In the 80s it was probably bistros or something. 
You're right about the hipster replacing the yuppie thing.
&gt; A bloody chorus of remember-whens

I'm stealing that phrase.
&gt;A bloody chorus of remember-whens, trying to turn the city into a theme park dedicated to their childhood.

This. This describes the "native" edgeords of this sub so perfectly 
To be fair, if there's a theme park where Joe Montana is still the quarterback of the Super Bowl contending 49ers, I am down with that theme park. 

Bonus points if there's naked showers with Frank Jordan! Woohoo!
&gt; "native" edgelords

Gee, wonder why you have a hard time with the natives....jerk. 
Did I touch a nerve there buddy? I have no problems with SF natives as a whole, they're, for the most part, chill people. 

There are some prominent users here who claim to be natives and act like absolute assholes, and that's who I have problems with. 
&gt; Bearded men in rolled up jeans, flouting the laws of comfort and hygiene to wear brogues without socks.

Somebody's obviously never heard of no-show socks.
I could recite the Home Turf theme song for you.
If steady improvements over 25 years means something 'lost its soul', then the planet earth probably became a soulless piece of rock some time in the 19th century. 

One example I have is going to the San Francisco Conservatory as an 8 year old kid back in the 90s. 

[It was in a charming little building on Ortega street](https://sfcmhistoryblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/sfcm_archives_ortega_st.jpg)... the staff called the 'taco bell headquarters' because of its old spanish architecture. It was quaint and nice...had lots of soul.

The conservatory since moved to [a beautiful location on Oak Street near the Civic Center](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/San_Francisco_Conservatory_of_Music_-_DSC02724.JPG). It had large, professional quality auditoriums for concerts and recitals. 

The school became more expensive, perhaps the demographics changed (though I'm not sure). However, it never lost its history or its charm. It just joined the 21st century. That's what's happening in San Francisco as a whole.


As a long time resident in the Sunset, I loved that place.  It felt folksy and inviting, which was important for a place where everyone with legitimate business for being there was insanely more talented than I will ever be.  The new place I'm intimidated to enter.  Even if I happen to be in the area, I'm no longer inclined to just go and enjoy the rehearsals of those who would let me listen in.
I don't think the public is allowed to enter the new conservatory unless they buy tickets for a concert. I remember I needed a badge or security wouldn't let me in. But that makes sense given that the Civic Center area has a lot more crime than the sunset. 
News to me, but not really surprised.  It has been years, but the last time I was there was with a friend who'd been a student studying the double bass.  I don't recall any specific security measures at the time, but it maybe well had been the case my presence in his company got me through.  Too bad.  At the old 19th ave address, it was easy to just stroll in and checkout the bulletin board while a piano or flute recital happened down the hall.
Ya, steady improvements to civic infrastructure is obviously not what people are talking about when the say SF is losing its soul. 



They are talking about the loss of creatives and eccentrics, unique and down to earth local businesses, cheap food and night life, live music, cultural enclaves (vs. the homogeneous shmear that started in the Marina and has steadily moved south), and just a counter-cultural and rebellious vibe. That's all leaving the city, every day.

edit: this commentor gets it:

&gt;For me, the soul was not in the taste of the food/drinks or the newness of a new place to hang out. It wasn't about 4 star restaurants and standing in line for an hour for some baked goods. It was the mood and vibe of an old bookstore, record store, cafe or bar. It was being a young person connecting with the older generations through art, politics, history and culture, and feeling like that was new and that was an awakening. Is SF still a great place to live? Of course - that's why the rent is so high. But having soul is an entirely different thing
&gt; Ya, steady improvements to civic infrastructure is obviously not what people are talking about when the say SF is losing its soul.

Its a mixed bag.  Parts of the waterfront has gone to shit while other areas have benefited from capital investment.  Elsewhere, it seems that there are more potholes and cracked sidewalks than the City can get around fixing at times.  It is ugly and annoying, but I suppose the various construction sites and freshly dug up roads/streets *are* for the better.  I just wish they keep up to the extent that there is an overall sense of beautification rather than perpetual maintenance.
While SF might be experiencing a change in that type of culture, I ask you what parts of the country are still like that? Historic artist enclaves and other areas of cultural significance no longer cater to the bohemian crowd in general. Greenwich village is a great example of there being an overall shift in the sustainability of the bohemian culture. I'm sure certain smaller cities like Portland might still have that culture and lifestyle but for larger cities, the young beatnik/bohemian individuals are becoming less common across the board.
Oakland? Seems like the standard reply here in SF.
While I know Oakland maybe the sort of standard response my overall point is that bohemian culture thrives in instances where there is affordable housing near a metropolitan area. Oakland is also becoming less and less affordable as well as rents are skyrocketing. Plain and simple, the artists and the beatniks can't survive on low income when the cost of living is insanely high. Even public workers like teachers/firemen/police can not afford to live in cities they work in.
And I think this is largely due to a shift in where people want to live.  Nationally cities are drivers for jobs even more than they have be in the past and people want to live near where they work (at least temporally).

More people want to live in cities and more demand for housing (and with little being built here in the bay area) the more expensive the city has become.
There's definitely more of that vibe in Oakland rather than SF nowadays, but I wonder how long it will last. Even West Oakland is slowly being eroded away by high-earners.
That's because most of those bohemian and artist communities were able at the time to move into cities thanks to white flight and economic crises that made them affordable.

As the economy gets better, cost of living rises. Artists are kicked out. Mom-and-pop businesses that didn't adapt disappear. It's one big giant cycle.

Artist communities are now relocating to the boonies of the state. I see them in unexpected places: Eureka, Nevada City, Chico, Cobb, Arcata, Mendocino, Grass Valley, etc.
That is very true, places like the Pacific Northwest is great for lots of artists colonies.
I think this is really subjective. The reason I've lived here my whole life and will never leave is due to the vibe. Not because a hot 4 star restaurant opened up in SoMa. 
I feel like that vibe is gone though. I just moved to Berkeley, and I feel like it has a lot of what SF has lost. 
Not gone, but it feels that way sometimes. It's definitely frustrating, but there are a lot of people who passionately want to keep it alive. Enough? Maybe, we'll see. 
Confirmation bias. 
&gt; and just a counter-cultural and rebellious vibe. That's all leaving the city, every day.

Pretty sure tech is as counter-culture as it gets my friend. Honestly tech in SF is the most San Francisco thing to happen to San Francisco in a long time, and will be looked back on in history and compared with our other glorious movements of the past like the Gold Rush. It's just funny because this time around the creatives/outcasts/artists/dreamers/etc are making money from it, so they get shunned by people like you. It's absolutely fucking bonkers the way people in this city think sometimes, as demonstrated by the quote you posted. Ya nostalgia is a pretty powerful emotion and reminiscing about the past is bittersweet. What does this have to do with anything about SF? This is valid literally everywhere because places change.
There's nothing counter-culture about the current tech scene.
Of course there is. You just aren't trained to appreciate the art that goes into software development.
/s or nah?
[Hell Nah.](https://www.ted.com/talks/golan_levin_on_software_as_art?language=en#t-148646)
Golan and that crew are so far from the tech scene in sf its basically a completely different thing.  There's some overlap in people (sounds like you and i are) but that's the exception rather than the rule.

Most of the cool tech art stuff is happening in new york, though gray area is definitely bringing some of that around.

Regardless, art != counterculture.
Counterculture is defined as:

&gt;a way of life and set of attitudes opposed to or at variance with the prevailing social norm.

Let's parse this. 

&gt;a way of life

Tech is not the profession of most Americans, so that box is definitely ticked. Most also work more than 9 to 5, which is a common feature of most American jobs.

&gt;and set of attitudes

Companies like Apple certainly have a different set of attitudes. Do the words "Think Different" mean anything to you? Not to mention the revolutionary product design of Jobs and Wozniak that challenged the beige box design of PCs.

&gt;opposed to or at variance with 

See above answers.

&gt;the prevailing social norm

Ingenuity is a form of going against the prevailing social norm. 

We can therefore conclude that tech is quite countercultural indeed, even in its non-artistic aspects.


Damn so everyone scraping by with a side hustle is part of the counterculture?  I don't think so.  Even apple was a beige box for a long time, you may be too young to remember the pre iMac days though.  If you want to get down to it Woz was counter culture, Jobs wanted to make money.
Tech was counterculture 30-40 years ago, before it became the most reasonable way to make lots of money.  Apple hasn't been counterculture in at least 20 years, even if their slogan is still "think different".  Apple is quite literally "the man" now.

I disagree with your sentiment so hard here, it sounds like you've drank all the kool-aid there is.
Nothing says counter culture like VC funding, IPO, and liquidity events... 
What about ingenuity? Genius? Revolutionary new apps?
The Silicon Valley tech scene hasn't been a force of counter culture since the days of the Apple I and the Whole Earth Catalog.
Agreed that Jobs was a true brainiac and we likely won't see a Great Mind like his for a generation, but you're not being fair to the future Edisons coming to this city to help spring humanity forward.
Oh, I'm a true believer that tech is making the world a better place, but the industry is entirely mainstream and not at all counter-cultural.
lol, creating apps that do for you you what your mom can't since you moved away isn't 'counter-culture' or creative at all. 
True revolutionaries use a service that picks up and drops off their laundry. 
You are so fucking high. Jesus Christ. Are you trolling?
&gt; (vs. the homogeneous shmear that started in the Marina and has steadily moved south)

If you think SF is turning into a homogenous shmear then that's on you. Stop being the white person who complains about how there's so many white people yet refuses to go anywhere where there's not a lot of white people. 

You go to where I grew up, it's a lot more diverse. You may not want to and that's fine, but you've lost your right to complain about diversity if you don't want it.
The cultural smear is not white people, it's the generic coffee shops, boutiques, dry bars, "American - new" restaurants, and bro bars. And it's the lack of older people, of non-professionals, working class families, immigrant families.



How is San Francisco becoming a cultural shmear on me? I didn't do a damn thing thing to bring it about. And anyway, this whole post is not about apportioning blame. Cities, *especially* great ones, change -- everyone knows that. A bunch of people coming here and dropping "cities change" like its a mind blowing fact bomb for intransigent locals are just being obnoxious. This post about acknowledging that in many ways, San Francisco *is* becoming less vibrant, less unique, less interesting, no matter what the recent arrivals want to think or say.


Back when I lived in the city, I spent plenty of time in the Outer Richmond and the Sunset, and would make it out the the Outer Mission occasionally as well, thank you very much.
&gt; How is San Francisco becoming a cultural shmear on me?

Because it's not. The limited places where you hang out turning into the Marina doesn't mean the whole city is that way. The Ingleside, the Excelsior, Crocker-Amazon, all places remarkably free of dry bars (what a dreadful phenomena) and new American food featuring pan-fried turbot. 
What is a 'dry bar'?

It sounds like a place where I would get my hopes up before going in and then have them dashed very quickly while locking me in for 4 hours.
A bar that doesn't serve booze. IOW, prison.
Ingleside is changing. I just got done living there for 2 years. It's still cool though, but all those luxury condos where the kragen aren't exactly a great addition. You can't get a cheap burger at beeps anymore either. My friends I went to high school with  just opened ocean ale house, you should check it out if you haven't yet. 
That's a shame about Beep's, although it looks like I could destroy my diet there with a 1/2 lb burger, shake and fries for about $15, which isn't really awful for SF. 

I don't mind the condos, but they're kinda ugly. They look like the kind of condos that you might score a deal for 20 years from now because the concrete's weathered and it's become undesirable. 
&gt;And it's the lack of older people, of non-professionals, working class families, immigrant families.

Nonsense. North Beach is filled to the brim with beatniks and hippies who never left. The Outer Mission, Crocker-Amazon, and Excelsior are filled with working class immigrant families who own their own homes. The avenues are filled with plenty of people like that too. What you're pointing out has only really happened to the trendy neighborhoods (Mission, SoMa, Castro, etc). 
The building they left was one of two Spanish style buildings of it's kind in SF, and the other one was replaced by a giant cube.  You can't begrudge a school from moving to a more modern building if given the chance, but there's something about joining an old institution in a beautiful old building nowhere near the Philharmonic, that worked for it.

At least one major worldwide musical movement started in that building they moved on from. The change provided a better operation for the school, but it's a tougher equation if you're talking cultural. 
I've lived here 10 years... Which conservatory?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Conservatory_of_Music
What about the conservatory of flowers? Or dance? Or clowns?
You're lucky the post even called it the San Francisco Conservatory, it's often just called The Conservatory, and there's no confusion.
Brb, need to write an angry op ed
I hear there's a site called Medium made just for you.


what about them?
So im a recent transplant and therefore this means nothing, but i saw a street performer yesterday  juggling 6-7 tennis balls at the stoplight immediately exiting the 101 onto Fuller (area). He timed his performance exactly in the middle of the crosswalk exactly on time to the traffic light, giving himself enough time to walk by the two lanes of cars and collect any offered money.

It felt so amazingly unique and genuine and i drove away thinking, only in SF. 
Fulton?
Saw this exact thing last week 
yeah, only in sf can someone who is so talented at juggling be so down and out that they have to make ends meet by doing street shows for cars, i wonder how many fights this person has to go through just to hold that spot from homeless people also begging for change at the stop lights or even other desperate performers? this comment right here is a shining example of exactly how the current trends in sf are decimating artists/performers/musicians etc. maybe its no one's fault but it is happening. 
As someone who has grown up in sanfransco from 1989 till 2014. Yes. Yes it has. And most people who have been there a while ago and now. Agree. It's image is more for the tourist than a true vibe.

SF is much much different than it used to be. A lot of it with who the city caters to. And how much money u need to do normal things. 
-SF lost it's soul when..Spain colonized it in 1776


-SF lost it's soul again when..it became part of Mexico in 1821


-SF lost it's soul again when..influx of people due to the gold rush of 1849


-SF lost it's soul again when..it became a major military hub for world war ii


-SF lost it's soul again when..hippy counterculture hit in the 1960s


-SF lost it's soul again when..the technology economic booms hit.


Maybe we, as human beings, just don't cope well with change if we aren't the ones creating the change.

I would argue that SF largely has stood up as a beacon of counter culture over the last 50 years and tech just is not the only thing that is driving the massive change. The majority of tech workers who make 90-120k can't afford to buy reasonable homes in the city. In fact the majority of tech firms operate more out of Silicon Valley and the peninsula than San Francisco. The low supply of housing and high demand has basically made it that newcomers need to be substantially wealthy to afford houses out here.
My experience is that the people owning real estate in sf are the same as always in big cities--senior executives, finance/legal professionals, entrepreneurial physicians and dentists, etc
Or they've owned it for far longer than most people have been here, and they either a) still live there or b) have since moved out and are renting it.  I have many neighbors who are just normal, down to earth working class people (not senior executives) that fall into the a) category.
Yeah, but that's the story with coastal/urban real estate in general.  If you go to socal and look near the coast, you see the same phenomenon.  

Problem is that the US didn't plan well for managing in-demand real-estate areas.  The american assumption is that there's always enough space somewhere, and you can just stick people there.  In the modern world, which prizes synergy and proximity, this is a faulty assumption.
Eh not really. Anyone with a modest income could invest in property as recent as 15 years ago. My parents bought a building with 2 condos in it for 300k 15 years ago. Same building now is over a mil. 
Which is largely because San Francisco was a struggling area throughout the 80s-90s.  
&gt;finance/legal professionals

Even attorneys can't afford homes here anymore, unless they're top tier corporate lawyers. Source: work in a law office and my boss can barely afford the rent at her place in Pacific Heights
SF was losing its soul before it was cool
This is just how time works - things change after a while. You know the stereotype of the jaded hipster who thinks that a thing was so much better in the past before the proverbial *they* showed up? This is exactly the same.
Yes. But the view of what SF was is not really anymore. The title says it's not true. It is. Plain and simple. You even just said it. 
Ya, things change. Right now, things in SF are changing for the worse. That's the point.
According to you. Your opinion. 
...and there's the jaded hipster.
haha, good one. You called me a hipster. I guess that means you win?
He predicted that you would play the jaded hipster in the previous comment and you did, so, yes, he did win.
Uh, he's said "the change isn't bad", and if you disagree that makes you a hipster and that makes you wrong? It's not just obnoxious, it's circular logic.
It's actually not the same as being jaded. It's having an awareness for a decline and seeing not just changes, but detrimental ons. Things don't normally change at the speed and method which SF has experienced. 

You can use the seemingly innocent idea of widening sidewalks on Castro for a case study. What a mistake.
I am genuinely curious, what happened?
The widened sidewalks are full of beggars, homeless, gutter punks, getting pushed around from section to section, and it's beginning to look more like Telegraph than Castro. 
Thank you
What happened?
I've lived here almost 10 years. I couldn't agree more with you, and I say that as someone who very much is, "the problem."

But what would you have me and others like me do? This place is a paradise. You can get a high paying job doing almost nothing. In many cases contributing literally nothing, because whatever you do is gone in 2 years. You put in some time in a nice office, joke around with friends, and go home with a huge paycheck. The hardest part about your life is sometimes putting in long hours with friends and free food. Temperate climate, tons of things to do, great food. I always wonder if the party can last forever. 

Sure, every bar is the same now. Some hipster cliche bullshit. Rents are through the roof. Most of the art and artists have been pushed out. The monoculture is real.

But why not? We are living in an extraordinary bubble. People and those like me are part of "the problem," but given the alternatives… I'd rather just be part of the problem. 
&gt;  You can get a high paying job doing almost nothing.

If it was easy everyone would do it.
What are you doing that's so easy and pays so well? 
I could care less about the gripes. San Francisco has changed dramatically for the worse.   If it was still real, there would be no way that Ed Lee could have ever run unopposed.  The assholes are the majority and SF is just another boring, run off the mill, monolithic American city.  This place used to be filled with wonderful people, who did all sorts of interesting things.  Now it's full of the tech crowd, who are lame, boring and think that their royal presence is actually adding something to our community.  
Around ~12% of the city, actually.
~12%? What's that from?
Working off of some old numbers from Bloomberg and Bay Area Council's Economic Institute.

I haven't seen a new one in a while.
For what though?
% of the city's workforce that is "tech crowd".
Ah. So their loud presence is bigger than the numbers. 
It's not lost, I know exactly where it is! ~~At the bottom of the bay!~~ In Oakland!
Yes it has! Nobody else move here it totally sucks!
[MRW I saw the title of this thread](https://media.tenor.co/images/54451401d52c0dd2fe9ee5752857d53c/raw)
Yup,  I was at least hoping it would be a good article with some decent points.  Oh well,  came for the comments anyway... 
This post is going to be upvoted by a bunch of transplants that wouldn't know otherwise.
Bullseye.  SF overall has not worsened that much.  But the changes have disproportionately been better mostly for newcomers.  Those are the people who haven't been around long enough to to appreciate a vibrant old soul.

The ice skating rink in the outer sunset.

The old Mint.

Various small-businesses/mom&amp;pop-shops that were the local hang outs for those old enough to have remembered being young here.

All my favorite BOOKSTORES!

So much is gone, supplanted by the rise in prosperity and importance of newer neighborhoods and a different variety of commercial interests.  

SF will never lose its soul.  But the soul of a different generation just isn't the same. 

edit:  I'd love to hear from those willing to share memories and nostalgia.  Anyone remember the bagpipe busker that played in Union Square for a spell?  Some thought he was annoying, but I loved it.
I think the biggest issue with people in SF is that they are so focused on the change that has happened here that they do not understand it is going on everywhere.  

The best possible example is this: 

&gt; All my favorite BOOKSTORES!

Bookstores are not a profitable business model now that the internet is here.  They are not profitable anywhere in the united states. 

&gt; SF will never lose its soul. But the soul of a different generation just isn't the same.

Nailed it. 

I grew up in Florida and have lived in a few different places.  People in SF complain because rents went up.  In florida, they have basically bulldozed hundreds of thousands of acres of trees to replace them with track housing.  There are 7bn people on earth and there will likely be 14bn by the end of this century.  Change is inevitable.  I hope that as I get older I continue looking forward to new stuff and a new way of life.  I plan on trying to evolve.  Maybe it won't work.
You realize that without having lived through the changes in SF, you're not making an educated statement. Which isn't to say all major cities don't go through some changes, but why attempt to diminish what we're saying? 

Is it because you want more changes that you think you need to discredit the idea that the city is unique? 
Christ, what is it about SF that makes every local act like a 70 year old retiree when it comes to changes in the town?

You might as well start yelling at kids to get off your lawn.
Perhaps because some people think the City and County of San Francisco is actually the HOA of San Francisco...you know, to keep the neighborhood in character, be suspicious of change, and generally get in other people's business out of a sense of self-righteousness...
Because San Franciscans haven't seen or accepted change to their city? 

Your lines are so tired. 
You act like you have a choice. SF is going to change, just like every other city in the world. 100 years from now, this city will look nothing like it does today. Just like it looks very little like it did 100 years ago. 

Keep yelling at the kids to get off your lawn. See how well that works.
&gt; Just like it looks very little like it did 100 years ago.

That's not entirely true either.

It also cheapens your lame caricature that we're against change.

You can't even admit SF is unique. That's lame.

Every city is unique. Moscow is nothing like London, which is nothing like NYC, which is nothing like SF. In the grand scheme of things, being unique doesn't really matter.

Do you honestly think this city hasn't changed since 1916? Here's a map from 1915:

http://bit.ly/2cHEz2j

The sunset was still sand dunes. We didn't even run out of land in SF proper until the mid 50s. SF is significantly different than it was 100 years ago, and even more so than 110 years ago.

&gt; It also cheapens your lame caricature that we're against change.

Not really. You guys fight it, but it's happening either way. All you're doing is making it a lot more painful for everyone around here.
You're proclaiming every city is unique, to deny SF of it's uniqueness.
Sourdough is just white bread to you. 

&gt;Do you honestly think this city hasn't changed since 1916? 

Are you having a conversation or reading a script? I've clearly said this fact cheapens your other smear tactics saying old timers don't accept change. Stop talking out of both sides of your mouth.

We still haven't "run out of land proper", it's just fear mongering from people like you that say otherwise.

Its because the people that they're arguing with tend to act so pretentiously, like spoiled teenagers. Eager to make a point, but listen just long enough to decide which counterpoint to argue with. A city will always change, but this city is changing into a playground for brats. 
lol ok.

It amazes me how much supposed liberals in San Francisco have in common with conservatives in the south.
What makes you think I'm a liberal? I'm not. Thats what I mean about pretentious -- it always starts with some straw man argument (read: some made-up bullshit assumption) and then is mixed with this weird masturbatory superiority complex.


I've met so many people like you in this city. You exist elsewhere, too, but holy shit has it gotten more common in the Bay.
&gt; You realize that without having lived through the changes in SF, you're not making an educated statement. 

I'll bite, why do you think that?

&gt; Which isn't to say all major cities don't go through some changes, but why attempt to diminish what we're saying?

I am simply saying that complaining about losing bookstores is like complaining about type writers no longer being available.  It completely ignores basic realities and is really painful to read. 

&gt; Is it because you want more changes that you think you need to discredit the idea that the city is unique?

The city is not as unique as people think it is.  It has slightly better weather than the other, major cities where a car isn't required, but it is not some special snow flake.  

The redevelopment of the mission is a perfect example.  People call it gentrification, but what is happening is just a return of the upper middle class that left in the 60s.  That is happening in every major city in this country.  
You mentioned growing up in Florida and a few different places.
Which would mean you didn't grow up in SF. I couldn't tell you the first thing about growing up in Florida, besides knowing it wasn't interchangeable with SF. This bizarre notion that SF wasn't a unique place is comical.

I agree with you about bookstores, but I think you might be taking it on the literal side. 

&gt;but it is not some special snow flake.

There it is Ladies and Gentleman. I hope you had that saved to your clipboard.  You're wrong. San Francisco is about as special of a snowflake as any city can be, and just a little more. Please don't talk about the weather and think you're even having the same conversation.

&gt; what is happening is just a return of the upper middle class that left in the 60s.

I'm going to put you and every others like you on notice, because I know you mean well, and I appreciate that you have a desire to crib together some understanding of SF history.... You do not know what you're talking about. Faking it and grasping some truths isn't enough. Again, I applaud you for wanting to understand that history, but.....The Mission wasn't Upper Middle Class. 

I'm curious as to how old you are, and how much traveling you've done (outside of the Bay Area, and California)?
You shouldn't be. The claim isn't that SF is the only petri dish of culture, it's that it's a remarkable one with few parallels. 

Your lack of awareness for that isn't a sign of my lack of awareness for other great cultural meccas...or to shut down the idea that any random ass town in America is about the same as SF. 

We live in a special snowflake. Sorry if you're here and still don't get that. The loss is yours. 
So I can assume the answer is "I'm young and have never traveled outside of the area."

Got it - thanks!
Would that make you feel better about your own shortcomings where SF is concerned? Your trying to belittle an SF you know nothing about.

If you've been  paying any small amount of attention to sugarwax1's posts (you can also just click his name, if you're not too lazy), you'll know for sure that this person isn't as young or inexperienced as you're assuming. Quite the contrary.

&gt; complaining about type writers no longer being available.

And why should that be something to be scoffed at?  I still love those for being great at filling out certain forms in hardcopy.  Speaking out about the passing of things is about acknowledging reality, not ignoring it.  The loss of book stores, however inevitable it may be due to economic forces, marks the end of an era for a distinct experience.  Maybe such experiences mean little to you, but I'm not mourning your loss.  This isn't just your city now.  Its legacy for me and others here is far more meaningful for our participation in it through the ages.  If you can't appreciate that, you deserve no respect in reciprocity.
Back in the 80's/90's, Stonestown had a different set of retailers.  The Northern wing was anchored by The Good Guys below and Tower Records above.  My most enduring memory however was a place on the second level of the main building - a boutique called "Candleman" that sold small liquid-fueled crystal lamps.  It was the prittiest, most tranquil place of all the shops.  I was just a poor student then.  But I still have a small orb with a hummingbird I bought there that I have yet to gift the special someone who deserve to be paired with the joyous memory of that place.
Hell, before then it was open air and didn't have a second story.
http://www.outsidelands.org/stonestown.php

I remember the stonestown of the 90's/early 00's the best but the Internet has really changed what a mall even is nowadays, we really can't go back much as we'd like.

It's gotten better/worse all the time. Borders books leaving was a big loss for me since I'd love to browse the comics there before a meet-up or after classes. Sports Authority unceremoniously replaced it, but I got used to it, at least as a shoe store but even that's gone now. 

Even minor things like the various stores swapping old spots for new ones or things that first seemed great, like the apple store, you got used to and burnt out on the newness of later on (unless you needed that one damn cable).

It's still nice to go when it isn't overly crowded,  even if it isnt the most amazing or unique place in town. At least I still think so.
Westfield was as stiff a kick to the pants of Stonestown as the Internet was, tbh.

Stonestown used to be SF's elite shopping mall. That changed overnight when Westfield opened.

I miss old, booming Stonestown (and oh man do I miss bookstores, even Borders) but tbh, it's not worth getting teary-eyed over a freaking shopping mall. 
I live near Stonestown, still a very good mall imo. Really hope something awesome replaces Sports Authority. 
&gt; and oh man do I miss bookstores, even Borders

Hear, hear!  It was at nearby Crown Books on Sloat Blvd. that I first discovered Victorian-era erotica.  Why they allowed those stuff on the shelves for underaged kids like me to find while making such a big deal about Playboy being "pornography" still bewilders me to this day.
&gt; Back in the 80's/90's, Stonestown had a different set of retailers.

And you'd get there by riding the M line when streetcars were still the old curvy white &amp; orange Boeing-made light rail vehicles.  Good times.
The ice skating rink... you're killing me. I even miss the snack bar.
I miss The Epicenter record store co-op on Valencia. Fucking incredible. I miss the weirdos. I miss people not fucking crying about the homeless or that certain areas are dangerous. I miss people being unique. I miss walking into bathrooms at bars and reading hilarious shit on the walls. I miss bartenders kicking out fucking retards from the bar. I miss people skating at the embarcadero. I miss the grit.

I miss almost everything that's gone from this place and I can't fucking stand this new entitled attitude that absolutely did NOT exist before because you'd get your ass kicked for acting like such a douche unless you knew your place and you hung out on Chestnut or Union and left the rest of us alone, as we did them.

To think that SF hasn't lost most of its soul means you don't know shit about anything.
You hit the nail on the head. I'd add to this list of things missed the Red Vic Theatre, the Lumiere Theatre and KUSF.
KUSF :'(  I've got a KUSF logo mug at home from years and years ago. The handle broke but we couldn't bring ourselves to throw it out, so its a lil flower pot now.
Speaking of defunct radio stations, Smooth Jazz 103.7 KKSF was an old favorite that I really miss, especially the program "Sunday Mornings".
Fucking KUSF... Nothing short of a tragedy with that loss and there's no replacement. One of our greatest misfortunes as they'd always play great local bands to discover. Well, most local bands don't even really exist anymore because venues have closed and are closing and people are content with Spotify.

I miss Rock 'n Bowl (not like Amoeba is a horrible replacement but SF was unique and weird and fun and sustained Rock 'n Bowl for a while), I miss creamed corn wrestling at Zeitgeist, I miss all the weirdos that would enter the Soap Box Derby, I miss saying that nobody in SF is a freak because EVERYONE is, and somehow I even miss all the bike messengers hanging out at the wall.

I guess I really just miss that SF was different than anywhere else in the world culturally and now it's just not. Nobody comes here because they don't fit in anywhere else, they now come here because someone has to develop an app that can get maids and snacks to your place on demand with one click.
They don't have ice skating at embarcadero anymore? Damn I had a lot of good memories there as a kid. And getting pizza at UNOs after. 
There was a legendary skateboard scene at the embarcadero. As far as I know they still do the yearly ice skating thing.
I hear there's a legendary electric skateboard scene in The Mission these days. 
heh, that's actually pretty funny! Who knew you had a sense of humor, keep it up.
I know guys who put car batteries in those electric skateboards and can nollie 400 feet over the building that should have been built way higher. Fucking NIMBYS
 &gt;To think that SF hasn't lost most of its soul means you don't know shit about anything.

That sums it up. How the hell would they even know?  

Another thing... half those people posting on message boards saying things have never changed would never know either, because they never saw half the city. They were scared of it, or they didn't have the internet and didn't know what existed. Now the weirdos are all in hiding, and the jocks with yoga mats and Malcolm Gladwell audiobooks are everywhere. 

Epicenter just did an anniversary last year, right?  


They did... That place was so special. Everyone who worked there volunteered their time. They had a pool and ping pong tables. You could bring a 40 in there and hang out while reading MRR and flipping through records. One of a kind.
When I moved away to college I was so glad that I wouldn't have to deal with anymore jock douchebags after I moved back home. I couldn't wait until I graduated...what a sad joke 
This sounds like a person who had the ability to participate in the city for a long time. Not all of us have had this privilege, and the city seems now a place that doesn't welcome every kind of person. I have friends who have seen their homeless friends by powerhosed on the streets. I've heard of friends who get gaybashed by bros who moved into historically queer areas of SF and Seattle. And of course, homeless queer youth have no place to plea for support who were displaced from other parts of America simply because their city/state community believes they should be dead over gay. And then they follow the rainbow road, and find only a city that doesn't have space for them.

If we talk more about the food and the beauty of the hills than we do the economic injustice of SF that has trickled into many other metro areas (poor bitch living in Vancouver, WA, Portland's older and less-known sister) then we are not having the same conversation. If you think the quality of a city equates more so to your comforts rather than other people's suffering, then OF COURSE you wouldn't see/understand the phrase "losing its soul." I may be negative and operating in poverty consciousness, but at the end of the day SF is not a city that welcomes everyone whatsoever.
